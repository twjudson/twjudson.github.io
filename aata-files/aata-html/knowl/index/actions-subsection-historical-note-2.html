<div class="para">William Burnside was born in London in 1852. He attended Cambridge University from 1871 to 1875 and won the Smith’s Prize in his last year. After his graduation he lectured at Cambridge. He was made a member of the Royal Society in 1893. Burnside wrote approximately 150 papers on topics in applied mathematics, differential geometry, and probability, but his most famous contributions were in group theory. Several of Burnside’s conjectures have stimulated research to this day. One such conjecture was that every group of odd order is solvable; that is, for a group <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> of odd order, there exists a sequence of subgroups</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">such that <span class="process-math">\(H_i\)</span> is normal in <span class="process-math">\(H_{i+1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H_{i+1} / H_i\)</span> is abelian. This conjecture was finally proven by W. Feit and J. Thompson in 1963. Burnside’s <span class="booktitle">The Theory of Groups of Finite Order</span>, published in 1897, was one of the first books to treat groups in a modern context as opposed to permutation groups. The second edition, published in 1911, is still a classic.</div>
