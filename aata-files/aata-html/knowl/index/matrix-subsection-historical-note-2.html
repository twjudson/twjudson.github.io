<div class="para">Symmetry groups have intrigued mathematicians for a long time. Leonardo da Vinci was probably the first person to know all of the point groups. At the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert gave a now-famous address outlining 23 problems to guide mathematics in the twentieth century. Hilbertâ€™s eighteenth problem asked whether or not crystallographic groups in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensions were always finite. In 1910, L. Bieberbach proved that crystallographic groups are finite in every dimension. Finding out how many of these groups there are in each dimension is another matter. In <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb R}^3\)</span> there are 230 different space groups; in <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb R}^4\)</span> there are 4783. No one has been able to compute the number of space groups for <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb R}^5\)</span> and beyond. It is interesting to note that the crystallographic groups were found mathematically for <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb R}^3\)</span> before the 230 different types of crystals were actually discovered in nature.</div>
