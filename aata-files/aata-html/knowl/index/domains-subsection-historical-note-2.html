<div class="para">Karl Friedrich Gauss, born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777, is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Gauss was truly a child prodigy. At the age of three he was able to detect errors in the books of his fatherâ€™s business. Gauss entered college at the age of 15. Before the age of 20, Gauss was able to construct a regular <span class="process-math">\(17\)</span>-sided polygon with a ruler and compass. This was the first new construction of a regular <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-sided polygon since the time of the ancient Greeks. Gauss succeeded in showing that if <span class="process-math">\(N= 2^{2^n} + 1\)</span> was prime, then it was possible to construct a regular <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span>-sided polygon.</div>
