<div class="para">Solutions for the cubic and quartic equations were discovered in the 1500s. Attempts to find solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of history’s best mathematicians. In 1798, P. Ruffini submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found; however, the paper was not well received. In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829) finally offered the first correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.</div>
