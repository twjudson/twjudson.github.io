  "body": " This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in abstract algebra. Traditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and fields. However, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that involve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important, and many science, engineering, and computer science students are now electing to minor in mathematics. Though theory still occupies a central role in the subject of abstract algebra and no student should go through such a course without a good notion of what a proof is, the importance of applications such as coding theory and cryptography has grown significantly.  Until recently most abstract algebra texts included few if any applications. However, one of the major problems in teaching an abstract algebra course is that for many students it is their first encounter with an environment that requires them to do rigorous proofs. Such students often find it hard to see the use of learning to prove theorems and propositions; applied examples help the instructor provide motivation.  This text contains more material than can possibly be covered in a single semester. Certainly there is adequate material for a two-semester course, and perhaps more; however, for a one-semester course it would be quite easy to omit selected chapters and still have a useful text. The order of presentation of topics is standard: groups, then rings, and finally fields. Emphasis can be placed either on theory or on applications. A typical one-semester course might cover groups and rings while briefly touching on field theory, using Chapters 1 through 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 (the first part), 16, 17, 18 (the first part), 20, and 21. Parts of these chapters could be deleted and applications substituted according to the interests of the students and the instructor. A two-semester course emphasizing theory might cover Chapters 1 through 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 through 18, 20, 21, 22 (the first part), and 23. On the other hand, if applications are to be emphasized, the course might cover Chapters 1 through 14, and 16 through 22. In an applied course, some of the more theoretical results could be assumed or omitted. A chapter dependency chart appears below. (A broken line indicates a partial dependency.)    Chapter dependency graph. Chapter 23 depends on Chapters 13 and 15. Chapter 22 depends on Chapter 21 and Chapter 8. Chapter 21 depends on Chapter 20. Chapters 18-20 depend on Chapter 17. Chapter 17 depends on Chapter 16. Chapter 15 depends on Chapter 14. Chapters 12, 13, 14, and 16 depend on Chapter 11. Chapter 11 depends on Chapter 10, which depends on Chapter 9. Chapters 7-9 depend on Chapters 1-6    Though there are no specific prerequisites for a course in abstract algebra, students who have had other higher-level courses in mathematics will generally be more prepared than those who have not, because they will possess a bit more mathematical sophistication. Occasionally, we shall assume some basic linear algebra; that is, we shall take for granted an elementary knowledge of matrices and determinants. This should present no great problem, since most students taking a course in abstract algebra have been introduced to matrices and determinants elsewhere in their career, if they have not already taken a sophomore or junior-level course in linear algebra.  Exercise sections are the heart of any mathematics text. An exercise set appears at the end of each chapter. The nature of the exercises ranges over several categories; computational, conceptual, and theoretical problems are included. A section presenting hints and solutions to many of the exercises appears at the end of the text. Often in the solutions a proof is only sketched, and it is up to the student to provide the details. The exercises range in difficulty from very easy to very challenging. Many of the more substantial problems require careful thought, so the student should not be discouraged if the solution is not forthcoming after a few minutes of work.  Ideally, students should read the relavent material before attending class. Reading questions have been added to each chapter before the exercises. To prepare for class, students should read the chapter before class and then answer the section's reading questions to prepare for the class.    There are additional exercises or computer projects at the ends of many of the chapters. The computer projects usually require a knowledge of programming. All of these exercises and projects are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration of new results and theory.   Sage ( sagemath.org ) is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics, which is ideal for assisting with a study of abstract algebra. Sage can be used either on your own computer, a local server, or on CoCalc ( cocalc.com ). Robert Beezer has written a comprehensive introduction to Sage and a selection of relevant exercises that appear at the end of each chapter, including live Sage cells in the web version of the book. All of the Sage code has been subject to automated tests of accuracy, using the most recent version available at this time: SageMath Version 10.3 (released 2024-03-19).     Thomas W.

  "title": "A Short Note on Proofs",
  "body": " A Short Note on Proofs   Abstract mathematics is different from other sciences. In laboratory sciences such as chemistry and physics, scientists perform experiments to discover new principles and verify theories. Although mathematics is often motivated by physical experimentation or by computer simulations, it is made rigorous through the use of logical arguments. In studying abstract mathematics, we take what is called an axiomatic approach; that is, we take a collection of objects and assume some rules about their structure. These rules are called axioms . Using the axioms for , we wish to derive other information about by using logical arguments. We require that our axioms be consistent; that is, they should not contradict one another. We also demand that there not be too many axioms. If a system of axioms is too restrictive, there will be few examples of the mathematical structure.  A statement in logic or mathematics is an assertion that is either true or false. Consider the following examples:    .    All cats are black.     .     exactly when .    If and , then .     .   All but the first and last examples are statements, and must be either true or false.  A mathematical proof is nothing more than a convincing argument about the accuracy of a statement. Such an argument should contain enough detail to convince the audience; for instance, we can see that the statement exactly when is false by evaluating and noting that , an argument that would satisfy anyone. Of course, audiences may vary widely: proofs can be addressed to another student, to a professor, or to the reader of a text. If more detail than needed is presented in the proof, then the explanation will be either long-winded or poorly written. If too much detail is omitted, then the proof may not be convincing. Again it is important to keep the audience in mind. High school students require much more detail than do graduate students. A good rule of thumb for an argument in an introductory abstract algebra course is that it should be written to convince one's peers, whether those peers be other students or other readers of the text.  Let us examine different types of statements. A statement could be as simple as ; however, mathematicians are usually interested in more complex statements such as If , then , where and are both statements. If certain statements are known or assumed to be true, we wish to know what we can say about other statements. Here is called the hypothesis and is known as the conclusion . Consider the following statement: If and , then . The hypothesis is and ; the conclusion is . Notice that the statement says nothing about whether or not the hypothesis is true. However, if this entire statement is true and we can show that with is true, then the conclusion must be true. A proof of this statement might simply be a series of equations: .  If we can prove a statement true, then that statement is called a proposition . A proposition of major importance is called a theorem . Sometimes instead of proving a theorem or proposition all at once, we break the proof down into modules; that is, we prove several supporting propositions, which are called lemmas , and use the results of these propositions to prove the main result. If we can prove a proposition or a theorem, we will often, with very little effort, be able to derive other related propositions called corollaries .    Some Cautions and Suggestions  There are several different strategies for proving propositions. In addition to using different methods of proof, students often make some common mistakes when they are first learning how to prove theorems. To aid students who are studying abstract mathematics for the first time, we list here some of the difficulties that they may encounter and some of the strategies of proof available to them. It is a good idea to keep referring back to this list as a reminder. (Other techniques of proof will become apparent throughout this chapter and the remainder of the text.)   A theorem cannot be proved by example; however, the standard way to show that a statement is not a theorem is to provide a counterexample.    Quantifiers are important. Words and phrases such as only , for all , for every , and for some possess different meanings.    Never assume any hypothesis that is not explicitly stated in the theorem. You cannot take things for granted.     Suppose you wish to show that an object exists and is unique . First show that there actually is such an object. To show that it is unique, assume that there are two such objects, say and , and then show that .    Sometimes it is easier to prove the contrapositive of a statement. Proving the statement If , then is exactly the same as proving the statement If not , then not .     Although it is usually better to find a direct proof of a theorem, this task can sometimes be difficult. It may be easier to assume that the theorem that you are trying to prove is false, and to hope that in the course of your argument you are forced to make some statement that cannot possibly be true.   Remember that one of the main objectives of higher mathematics is proving theorems. Theorems are tools that make new and productive applications of mathematics possible. We use examples to give insight into existing theorems and to foster intuitions as to what new theorems might be true. Applications, examples, and proofs are tightly interconnected much more so than they may seem at first appearance.   "

  "body": " Sets and Equivalence Relations   Set Theory  A set is a well-defined collection of objects; that is, it is defined in such a manner that we can determine for any given object whether or not belongs to the set. The objects that belong to a set are called its elements or members . We will denote sets by capital letters, such as or ; if is an element of the set , we write .   is in the set     A set is usually specified either by listing all of its elements inside a pair of braces or by stating the property that determines whether or not an object belongs to the set. We might write for a set containing elements or if each in satisfies a certain property . For example, if is the set of even positive integers, we can describe by writing either . We write when we want to say that 2 is in the set , and to say that is not in the set .  Some of the more important sets that we will consider are the following: .   the natural numbers     the integers     the rational numbers     the real numbers     the complex numbers    We can find various relations between sets as well as perform operations on sets. A set is a subset of , written or , if every element of is also an element of .   is a subset of  For example, and . Trivially, every set is a subset of itself. A set is a proper subset of a set if but . If is not a subset of , we write ; for example, . Two sets are equal , written , if we can show that and .  It is convenient to have a set with no elements in it. This set is called the empty set and is denoted by . Note that the empty set is a subset of every set.   the empty set    To construct new sets out of old sets, we can perform certain operations: the union  of two sets and is defined as the intersection of and is defined by .   the union of sets and     the intersection of sets and  If and , then . We can consider the union and the intersection of more than two sets. In this case we write and for the union and intersection, respectively, of the sets .   When two sets have no elements in common, they are said to be disjoint ; for example, if is the set of even integers and is the set of odd integers, then and are disjoint. Two sets and are disjoint exactly when .  Sometimes we will work within one fixed set , called the universal set . For any set , we define the complement of , denoted by , to be the set   complement of the set   .  We define the difference of two sets and to be   difference between sets and   .

To show the reverse inclusion, suppose that . Then and , and so and . Thus and so . Hence, and so .  The proof of (2) is left as an exercise.     Other relations between sets often hold true. For example, . To see that this is true, observe that .     Cartesian Products and Mappings  Given sets and , we can define a new set , called the Cartesian product of and , as a set of ordered pairs. That is,   Cartesian product of sets and   .   If , , and , then is the set and .   We define the Cartesian product of sets to be . If , we often write for (where would be written times).   ( times)  For example, the set consists of all of 3-tuples of real numbers.  Subsets of are called relations . We will define a mapping Mapping Function or function Function definition of  from a set to a set to be the special type of relation where each element has a unique element such that . Another way of saying this is that for every element in , assigns a unique element in . We usually write or . Instead of writing down ordered pairs , we write or . The set is called the domain Function domain of of and is called the range Function range of or image of . We can think of the elements in the function's domain as input values and the elements in the function's range as output values.   Suppose and . In we define relations and from to . The relation is a mapping, but is not because is not assigned to a unique element in ; that is, and .   Mappings and relations    Two sets of ovals, A and B, relating 1, 2, 3 to a, b, c. The first mapping, f, sends 1 to b and 2 and 3 to c. The second relation, g, sends 1 to a and b, 2 to c, and 3 to a        Given a function , it is often possible to write a list describing what the function does to each specific element in the domain. However, not all functions can be described in this manner. For example, the function that sends each real number to its cube is a mapping that must be described by writing or .  Consider the relation given by . We know that , but is or ? This relation cannot be a mapping because it is not well-defined. A relation is well-defined Well-defined map if each element in the domain is assigned to a unique element in the range.  If is a map and the image of is , i.e., , then is said to be onto Function onto or Function surjective surjective . In other words, if there exists an for each such that , then is onto. A map is one-to-one Function one-to-one or injective Function injective if implies . Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if implies . A map that is both one-to-one and onto is called Function bijective bijective .    Let be defined by . Then is one-to-one but not onto. Define by where is a rational number expressed in its lowest terms with a positive denominator. The function is onto but not one-to-one.   Given two functions, we can construct a new function by using the range of the first function as the domain of the second function. Let and be mappings. Define a new map, the composition Function composition of of and from to , by .   Composition of maps    Two sets of ovals, A and B, relating 1, 2, 3 to a, b, c and a, b, c to X, Y, Z. The first mapping, f, sends 1 to b, 2 2 to c, and 3 to a. The second relation, g, sends a and b to Z and c to X. The bottom map, g circle f, sends 1 and 3 to Z and 2 to X.      Consider the functions and that are defined in (top). The composition of these functions, , is defined in (bottom).     Let and . Then and . In general, order makes a difference; that is, in most cases .    Sometimes it is the case that . Let and . Then and .    Given a matrix , we can define a map by for in . This is actually matrix multiplication; that is, . Maps from to given by matrices are called linear maps or Linear transformation definition of linear transformations .    Suppose that . Define a map by . This is a bijective map. An alternative way to write is . For any set , a one-to-one and onto mapping is called a permutation Permutation definition of of .     Let , , and . Then   The composition of mappings is associative; that is, ;    If and are both one-to-one, then the mapping is one-to-one;    If and are both onto, then the mapping is onto;    If and are bijective, then so is .       We will prove (1) and (3). Part (2) is left as an exercise. Part (4) follows directly from (2) and (3).  (1) We must show that . For we have .  (3) Assume that and are both onto functions. Given , we must show that there exists an such that . However, since is onto, there is an element such that . Similarly, there is an such that . Accordingly, .    If is any set, we will use or to denote the identity mapping Function identity from to itself. Define this map by for all . A map is an inverse mapping of if and ; in other words, the inverse function of a function simply undoes the function. A map is said to be invertible Function invertible if it has an inverse. We usually write for the inverse of .   identity mapping     inverse of the function     The function has inverse by .    The natural logarithm and the exponential functions, and , are inverses of each other provided that we are careful about choosing domains. Observe that and whenever composition makes sense.    Suppose that . Then defines a map from to by . We can find an inverse map of by simply inverting the matrix ; that is, . In this example, hence, the inverse map is given by . It is easy to check that . Not every map has an inverse. If we consider the map given by the matrix , then an inverse map would have to be of the form and for all and . Clearly this is impossible because might not be .    Given the permutation on , it is easy to see that the permutation defined by is the inverse of . In fact, any bijective mapping possesses an inverse, as we will see in the next theorem.     A mapping is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.    Suppose first that is invertible with inverse . Then is the identity map; that is, . If with , then . Consequently, is one-to-one. Now suppose that . To show that is onto, it is necessary to find an such that , but with . Let .  Conversely, let be bijective and let . Since is onto, there exists an such that . Because is one-to-one, must be unique. Define by letting . We have now constructed the inverse of .      Equivalence Relations and Partitions  A fundamental notion in mathematics is that of equality. We can generalize equality with equivalence relations and equivalence classes. An equivalence relation Equivalence relation on a set is a relation such that    for all ( reflexive property );     implies ( symmetric property );     and imply ( transitive property ).   Given an equivalence relation on a set , we usually write instead of . If the equivalence relation already has an associated notation such as , , or , we will use that notation.   Let , , , and be integers, where and are nonzero. Define if . Clearly is reflexive and symmetric. To show that it is also transitive, suppose that and , with , , and all nonzero. Then and . Therefore, . Since , . Consequently, .    Suppose that and are differentiable functions on . We can define an equivalence relation on such functions by letting if . It is clear that is both reflexive and symmetric. To demonstrate transitivity, suppose that and . From calculus we know that and , where and are both constants. Hence, and . Therefore, .    For and in , define if . Then is an equivalence relation on .    Let and be matrices with entries in the real numbers. We can define an equivalence relation on the set of matrices, by saying if there exists an invertible matrix such that . For example, if , then since for . Let be the identity matrix; that is, . Then ; therefore, the relation is reflexive. To show symmetry, suppose that . Then there exists an invertible matrix such that . So . Finally, suppose that and . Then there exist invertible matrices and such that and . Since , the relation is transitive. Two matrices that are equivalent in this manner are said to be Matrix similar similar .   A partition Partitions  of a set is a collection of nonempty sets such that for and . Let be an equivalence relation on a set and let . Then is called the equivalence class Equivalence class of . We will see that an equivalence relation gives rise to a partition via equivalence classes. Also, whenever a partition of a set exists, there is some natural underlying equivalence relation, as the following theorem demonstrates.    Given an equivalence relation on a set , the equivalence classes of form a partition of . Conversely, if is a partition of a set , then there is an equivalence relation on with equivalence classes .    Suppose there exists an equivalence relation on the set . For any , the reflexive property shows that and so is nonempty. Clearly . Now let . We need to show that either or . Suppose that the intersection of and is not empty and that . Then and . By symmetry and transitivity ; hence, . Similarly, and so . Therefore, any two equivalence classes are either disjoint or exactly the same.  Conversely, suppose that is a partition of a set . Let two elements be equivalent if they are in the same partition. Clearly, the relation is reflexive. If is in the same partition as , then is in the same partition as , so implies . Finally, if is in the same partition as and is in the same partition as , then must be in the same partition as , and transitivity holds.      Two equivalence classes of an equivalence relation are either disjoint or equal.    Let us examine some of the partitions given by the equivalence classes in the last set of examples.   In the equivalence relation in , two pairs of integers, and , are in the same equivalence class when they reduce to the same fraction in its lowest terms.    In the equivalence relation in , two functions and are in the same partition when they differ by a constant.    We defined an equivalence class on by if . Two pairs of real numbers are in the same partition when they lie on the same circle about the origin.    Let and be two integers and suppose that . We say that is congruent Congruence modulo to  modulo  , or is congruent to mod , if is evenly divisible by ; that is, for some . In this case we write .   is congruent to modulo  For example, since is divisible by . We claim that congruence modulo forms an equivalence relation of . Certainly any integer is equivalent to itself since is divisible by . We will now show that the relation is symmetric. If , then is divisible by . So is divisible by and . Now suppose that and . Then there exist integers and such that and . To show transitivity, it is necessary to prove that is divisible by . However, , and so is divisible by .  If we consider the equivalence relation established by the integers modulo , then . Notice that and also that the sets are disjoint. The sets , , and form a partition of the integers.  The integers modulo are a very important example in the study of abstract algebra and will become quite useful in our investigation of various algebraic structures such as groups and rings. In our discussion of the integers modulo we have actually assumed a result known as the division algorithm, which will be stated and proved in .    "

  "title": "Sage",
  "body": " Sage   Sage is a powerful system for studying and exploring many different areas of mathematics. In this textbook, you will study a variety of algebraic structures, such as groups, rings and fields. Sage does an excellent job of implementing many features of these objects as we will see in the chapters ahead. But here and now, in this initial chapter, we will concentrate on a few general ways of getting the most out of working with Sage.  You may use Sage several different ways. It may be used as a command-line program when installed on your own computer. Or it might be a web application such as the SageMathCloud. Our writing will assume that you are reading this as a worksheet within the Sage Notebook (a web browser interface), or this is a section of the entire book presented as web pages, and you are employing the Sage Cell Server via those pages. After the first few chapters the explanations should work equally well for whatever vehicle you use to execute Sage commands.    Executing Sage Commands  Most of your interaction will be by typing commands into a compute cell . If you are reading this in the Sage Notebook or as a webpage version of the book, then you will see a compute cell just below this paragraph. Click once inside the compute cell and if you are in the Sage Notebook, you will get a more distinctive border around it, a blinking cursor inside, plus a cute little evaluate link below.   At the cursor, type 2+2 and then click on the evaluate link. Did a 4 appear below the cell? If so, you have successfully sent a command off for Sage to evaluate and you have received back the (correct) answer.  Here is another compute cell. Try evaluating the command factorial(300) here.   Hmmmmm. That is quite a big integer! If you see slashes at the end of each line, this means the result is continued onto the next line, since there are 615 total digits in the result.  To make new compute cells in the Sage Notebook (only), hover your mouse just above another compute cell, or just below some output from a compute cell. When you see a skinny blue bar across the width of your worksheet, click and you will open up a new compute cell, ready for input. Note that your worksheet will remember any calculations you make, in the order you make them, no matter where you put the cells, so it is best to stay organized and add new cells at the bottom.  Try placing your cursor just below the monstrous value of that you have. Click on the blue bar and try another factorial computation in the new compute cell.  Each compute cell will show output due to only the very last command in the cell. Try to predict the following output before evaluating the cell.     The following compute cell will not print anything since the one command does not create output. But it will have an effect, as you can see when you execute the subsequent cell. Notice how this uses the value of b from above. Execute this compute cell once . Exactly once. Even if it appears to do nothing. If you execute the cell twice, your credit card may be charged twice.   Now execute this cell, which will produce some output.   So b came into existence as 6 . We subtracted immediately afterward. Then a subsequent cell added 50 . This assumes you executed this cell exactly once! In the last cell we create b+20 (but do not save it) and it is this value ( ) that is output, while b is still .  You can combine several commands on one line with a semi-colon. This is a great way to get multiple outputs from a compute cell. The syntax for building a matrix should be somewhat obvious when you see the output, but if not, it is not particularly important to understand now.      Immediate Help  Some commands in Sage are functions, an example is factorial() above. Other commands are methods of an object and are like characteristics of objects, an example is .inverse() as a method of a matrix. Once you know how to create an object (such as a matrix), then it is easy to see all the available methods. Write the name of the object, place a period ( dot ) and hit the TAB key. If you have A defined from above, then the compute cell below is ready to go, click into it and then hit TAB (not evaluate !). You should get a long list of possible methods.   To get some help on how to use a method with an object, write its name after a dot (with no parentheses) and then use a question-mark and hit TAB. (Hit the escape key ESC to remove the list, or click on the text for a method.)   With one more question-mark and a TAB you can see the actual computer instructions that were programmed into Sage to make the method work, once you scoll down past the documentation delimited by the triple quotes ( \"\"\" ):   It is worthwhile to see what Sage does when there is an error. You will probably see a lot of these at first, and initially they will be a bit intimidating. But with time, you will learn how to use them effectively and you will also become more proficient with Sage and see them less often. Execute the compute cell below, it asks for the inverse of a matrix that has no inverse. Then reread the commentary.   Click just to the left of the error message to expand it fully (another click hides it totally, and a third click brings back the abbreviated form). Read the bottom of an error message first, it is your best explanation. Here a ZeroDivisionError is not 100% accurate, but is close. The matrix is not invertible, not dissimilar to how we cannot divide scalars by zero. The remainder of the message begins at the top showing were the error first happened in your code and then the various places where intermediate functions were called, until the actual piece of Sage where the problem occurred. Sometimes this information will give you some clues, sometimes it is totally undecipherable. So do not let it scare you if it seems mysterious, but do remember to always read the last line first, then go back and read the first few lines for something that looks like your code.    Annotating Your Work  It is easy to comment on your work when you use the Sage Notebook. (The following only applies if you are reading this within a Sage Notebook. If you are not, then perhaps you can go open up a worksheet in the Sage Notebook and experiment there.) You can open up a small word-processor by hovering your mouse until you get a skinny blue bar again, but now when you click, also hold the SHIFT key at the same time. Experiment with fonts, colors, bullet lists, etc and then click the Save changes button to exit. Double-click on your text if you need to go back and edit it later.  Open the word-processor again to create a new bit of text (maybe next to the empty compute cell just below). Type all of the following exactly,   Pythagorean Theorem: $c^2=a^2+b^2$  and save your changes. The symbols between the dollar signs are written according to the mathematical typesetting language known as tex  cruise the internet to learn more about this very popular tool. (Well, it is extremely popular among mathematicians and physical scientists.)     Lists  Much of our interaction with sets will be through Sage lists. These are not really sets they allow duplicates, and order matters. But they are so close to sets, and so easy and powerful to use that we will use them regularly. We will use a fun made-up list for practice, the quote marks mean the items are just text, with no special mathematical meaning. Execute these compute cells as we work through them.   So the square brackets define the boundaries of our list, commas separate items, and we can give the list a name. To work with just one element of the list, we use the name and a pair of brackets with an index. Notice that lists have indices that begin counting at zero . This will seem odd at first and will seem very natural later.   We can add a new creature to the zoo, it is joined up at the far right end.   We can remove a creature.   We can extract a sublist. Here we start with element 1 (the elephant) and go all the way up to, but not including , element 3 (the beetle). Again a bit odd, but it will feel natural later. For now, notice that we are extracting two elements of the lists, exactly elements.   Often we will want to see if two lists are equal. To do that we will need to sort a list first. A function creates a new, sorted list, leaving the original alone. So we need to save the new one with a new name.    Notice that if you run this last compute cell your zoo has changed and some commands above will not necessarily execute the same way. If you want to experiment, go all the way back to the first creation of the zoo and start executing cells again from there with a fresh zoo.  A construction called a list comprehension is especially powerful, especially since it almost exactly mirrors notation we use to describe sets. Suppose we want to form the plural of the names of the creatures in our zoo. We build a new list, based on all of the elements of our old list.   Almost like it says: we add an s to each animal name, for each animal in the zoo, and place them in a new list. Perfect. (Except for getting the plural of ostrich wrong.)    Lists of Integers  One final type of list, with numbers this time. The srange() function will create lists of integers. (The s in the name stands for Sage and so will produce integers that Sage understands best. Many early difficulties with Sage and group theory can be alleviated by using only this command to create lists of integers.) In its simplest form an invocation like srange(12) will create a list of 12 integers, starting at zero and working up to, but not including , 12. Does this sound familiar?   Here are two other forms, that you should be able to understand by studying the examples.      Saving and Sharing Your Work  There is a Save button in the upper-right corner of the Sage Notebook. This will save a current copy of your worksheet that you can retrieve your work from within your notebook again later, though you have to re-execute all the cells when you re-open the worksheet.  There is also a File drop-down list, on the left, just above your very top compute cell (not be confused with your browser's File menu item!). You will see a choice here labeled Save worksheet to a file... When you do this, you are creating a copy of your worksheet in the sws format (short for Sage WorkSheet ). You can email this file, or post it on a website, for other Sage users and they can use the Upload link on the homepage of their notebook to incorporate a copy of your worksheet into their notebook.  There are other ways to share worksheets that you can experiment with, but this gives you one way to share any worksheet with anybody almost anywhere.  We have covered a lot here in this section, so come back later to pick up tidbits you might have missed. There are also many more features in the Sage Notebook that we have not covered.   "

  "body": " Mathematical Induction  Suppose we wish to show that for any natural number . This formula is easily verified for small numbers such as , , , or , but it is impossible to verify for all natural numbers on a case-by-case basis. To prove the formula true in general, a more generic method is required.  Suppose we have verified the equation for the first cases. We will attempt to show that we can generate the formula for the th case from this knowledge. The formula is true for since . If we have verified the first cases, then . This is exactly the formula for the th case.  This method of proof is known as mathematical induction . Instead of attempting to verify a statement about some subset of the positive integers on a case-by-case basis, an impossible task if is an infinite set, we give a specific proof for the smallest integer being considered, followed by a generic argument showing that if the statement holds for a given case, then it must also hold for the next case in the sequence. We summarize mathematical induction in the following axiom.   First Principle of Mathematical Induction   Induction  first principle of    Let be a statement about integers for and suppose is true for some integer . If for all integers with , implies that is true, then is true for all integers greater than or equal to .      For all integers , . Since , the statement is true for . Assume that for . Then . But since is positive. Hence, by induction, the statement holds for all integers .    Every integer is divisible by for . For , is divisible by . Suppose that is divisible by for . Then is divisible by .    We will prove the binomial theorem using mathematical induction; that is, , where and are real numbers, , and is the binomial coefficient.   factorial     binomial coefficient  We first show that . This result follows from . If , the binomial theorem is easy to verify. Now assume that the result is true for greater than or equal to . Then .   We have an equivalent statement of the Principle of Mathematical Induction that is often very useful.   Second Principle of Mathematical Induction   Induction  second principle of    Let be a statement about integers for and suppose is true for some integer . If imply that for , then the statement is true for all integers .     A nonempty subset of is well-ordered Well-ordered set if contains a least element. Notice that the set is not well-ordered since it does not contain a smallest element. However, the natural numbers are well-ordered.   Principle of Well-Ordering   Every nonempty subset of the natural numbers is well-ordered.    The Principle of Well-Ordering is equivalent to the Principle of Mathematical Induction.    The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies that is the least positive natural number.    Let . Then . Assume that . Since , it must be the case that . Therefore, . Consequently, if , then must also be in , and by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, and we have .        The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies the Principle of Well-Ordering. That is, every nonempty subset of contains a least element.    We must show that if is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers, then contains a least element. If contains 1, then the theorem is true by . Assume that if contains an integer such that , then contains a least element. We will show that if a set contains an integer less than or equal to , then has a least element. If does not contain an integer less than , then is the smallest integer in . Otherwise, since is nonempty, must contain an integer less than or equal to . In this case, by induction, contains a least element.     Induction can also be very useful in formulating definitions. For instance, there are two ways to define , the factorial of a positive integer .   The explicit definition: .    The inductive or recursive definition: and for .   Every good mathematician or computer scientist knows that looking at problems recursively, as opposed to explicitly, often results in better understanding of complex issues.  "

Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer . One problem in number theory is to find a function such that is prime for each integer . Pierre Fermat (1601? 1665) conjectured that was prime for all , but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707 1783) that is a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture. In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of seemed to be the sum of two primes: , , , . Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through , it has yet to be proven in general. Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.    "

  "body": " Sage   Many properties of the algebraic objects we will study can be determined from properties of associated integers. And Sage has many powerful functions for analyzing integers.    Division Algorithm  The code a % b will return the remainder upon division of by . In other words, the result is the unique integer such that (1) , and (2) for some integer (the quotient), as guaranteed by the Division Algorithm ( ). Then will equal . For example,    It is also possible to get both the quotient and remainder at the same time with the .quo_rem() method (quotient and remainder).   A remainder of zero indicates divisibility. So (a % b) == 0 will return True if divides , and will otherwise return False .    The .divides() method is another option.      Greatest Common Divisor  The greatest common divisor of and is obtained with the command gcd(a, b) , where in our first uses, and are integers. Later, and can be other objects with a notion of divisibility and greatness, such as polynomials. For example,   We can use the gcd command to determine if a pair of integers are relatively prime.    The command xgcd(a,b) ( eXtended GCD ) returns a triple where the first element is the greatest common divisor of and (as with the gcd(a,b) command above), but the next two elements are values of and such that .   Portions of the triple can be extracted using [ ] ( indexing ) to access the entries of the triple, starting with the first as number 0 . For example, the following should always return the result True , even if you change the values of a and b . Try changing the values of a and b below, to see that the result is always True .   Studying this block of code will go a long way towards helping you get the most out of Sage's output. Note that = is how a value is assigned to a variable, while as in the last line, == is how we compare two items for equality .    Primes and Factoring  The method .is_prime() will determine if an integer is prime or not.     The command random_prime(a, proof=True) will generate a random prime number between and . Experiment by executing the following two compute cells several times. (Replacing proof=True by proof=False will speed up the search, but there will be a very, very, very small probability the result will not be prime.)    The command prime_range(a, b) returns an ordered list of all the primes from to , inclusive. For example,   The commands next_prime(a) and previous_prime(a) are other ways to get a single prime number of a desired size. Give them a try below if you have an empty compute cell there (as you will if you are reading in the Sage Notebook, or are reading the online version). (The hash symbol, # , is used to indicate a comment line, which will not be evaluated by Sage. So erase this line, or start on the one below it.)   In addition to checking if integers are prime or not, or generating prime numbers, Sage can also decompose any integer into its prime factors, as described by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic ( ).   So and this is the unique way to write as a product of prime numbers (other than rearranging the order of the primes themselves in the product).  While Sage will print a factorization nicely, it is carried internally as a list of pairs of integers, with each pair being a base (a prime number) and an exponent (a positive integer). Study the following carefully, as it is another good exercise in working with Sage output in the form of lists.       The next compute cell reveals the internal version of the factorization by asking for the actual list. And we show how you could determine exactly how many terms the factorization has by using the length command, len() .    Can you extract the next two primes, and their exponents, from a ?    "

The Integers mod  The integers mod have become indispensable in the theory and applications of algebra. In mathematics they are used in cryptography, coding theory, and the detection of errors in identification codes.  We have already seen that two integers and are equivalent mod if divides . The integers mod also partition into different equivalence classes; we will denote the set of these equivalence classes by .   the integers modulo  Consider the integers modulo and the corresponding partition of the integers: . When no confusion can arise, we will use to indicate the equivalence classes respectively. We can do arithmetic on . For two integers and , define addition modulo to be ; that is, the remainder when is divided by . Similarly, multiplication modulo is defined as , the remainder when is divided by .   The following examples illustrate integer arithmetic modulo : . In particular, notice that it is possible that the product of two nonzero numbers modulo can be equivalent to modulo .    Most, but not all, of the usual laws of arithmetic hold for addition and multiplication in . For instance, it is not necessarily true that there is a multiplicative inverse. Consider the multiplication table for in . Notice that , , and do not have multiplicative inverses; that is, for , , or , there is no integer such that .

Then if and only if there exists a multiplicative inverse for ; that is, a nonzero integer such that .         We will prove (1) and (6) and leave the remaining properties to be proven in the exercises.  (1) Addition and multiplication are commutative modulo since the remainder of divided by is the same as the remainder of divided by .  (6) Suppose that . Then there exist integers and such that .

Symmetries    Rigid motions of a rectangle   The four symmetries ot a rectangle: (1) sending rectangle ABCD to rectangle ABCD, (2) sending rectangle ABCD to rectangle CDAB, (3) sending rectangle ABCD to rectangle BADC, and (4) sending rectangle ABCD to rectangle DCBA.     A symmetry of a geometric figure is a rearrangement of the figure preserving the arrangement of its sides and vertices as well as its distances and angles. A map from the plane to itself preserving the symmetry of an object is called a Rigid motion rigid motion . For example, if we look at the rectangle in , it is easy to see that a rotation of or returns a rectangle in the plane with the same orientation as the original rectangle and the same relationship among the vertices. A reflection of the rectangle across either the vertical axis or the horizontal axis can also be seen to be a symmetry. However, a rotation in either direction cannot be a symmetry unless the rectangle is a square.    Symmetries of a triangle   The six symmetries of a triangle: (1) triangle ABC to triangle ABC, (2) ABC to CAB, (3) ABC to BCA, (4) ABC to ACB, (5) ABC to CBA, and (6) ABC to BAC     Let us find the symmetries of the equilateral triangle . To find a symmetry of , we must first examine the permutations of the vertices , , and and then ask if a permutation extends to a symmetry of the triangle. Recall that a permutation of a set is a one-to-one and onto map . The three vertices have permutations, so the triangle has at most six symmetries. To see that there are six permutations, observe there are three different possibilities for the first vertex, and two for the second, and the remaining vertex is determined by the placement of the first two. So we have different arrangements. To denote the permutation of the vertices of an equilateral triangle that sends to , to , and to , we write the array . Notice that this particular permutation corresponds to the rigid motion of rotating the triangle by in a clockwise direction. In fact, every permutation gives rise to a symmetry of the triangle. All of these symmetries are shown in .  A natural question to ask is what happens if one motion of the triangle is followed by another. Which symmetry is ; that is, what happens when we do the permutation and then the permutation ? Remember that we are composing functions here. Although we usually multiply left to right, we compose functions right to left. We have . This is the same symmetry as . Suppose we do these motions in the opposite order, then . It is easy to determine that this is the same as the symmetry ; hence, . A multiplication table for the symmetries of an equilateral triangle is given in .  Notice that in the multiplication table for the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, for every motion of the triangle there is another motion such that ; that is, for every motion there is another motion that takes the triangle back to its original orientation.

It is often convenient to describe a group in terms of an addition or multiplication table. Such a table is called a Cayley table Cayley table .   The integers mod form a group under addition modulo . Consider , consisting of the equivalence classes of the integers , , , , and . We define the group operation on by modular addition. We write the binary operation on the group additively; that is, we write . The element 0 is the identity of the group and each element in has an inverse. For instance, . is a Cayley table for . By , is a group under the binary operation of addition mod .    Cayley table for        Not every set with a binary operation is a group. For example, if we let modular multiplication be the binary operation on , then fails to be a group. The element 1 acts as a group identity since for any ; however, a multiplicative inverse for does not exist since for every in . Even if we consider the set , we still may not have a group. For instance, let . Then 2 has no multiplicative inverse since . By , every nonzero does have an inverse in if is relatively prime to .

Multiplication table for        The symmetries of an equilateral triangle described in form a nonabelian group. As we observed, it is not necessarily true that for two symmetries and . Using , which is a Cayley table for this group, we can easily check that the symmetries of an equilateral triangle are indeed a group. We will denote this group by either or , for reasons that will be explained later.    We use to denote the set of all matrices. Let be the subset of consisting of invertible matrices; that is, a matrix   the matrices with entries in   is in if there exists a matrix such that , where is the identity matrix. For to have an inverse is equivalent to requiring that the determinant of be nonzero; that is, .   the determinant of  The set of invertible matrices forms a group called the Group general linear general linear group .   the general linear group  The identity of the group is the identity matrix . The inverse of is . The product of two invertible matrices is again invertible. Matrix multiplication is associative, satisfying the other group axiom. For matrices it is not true in general that ; hence, is another example of a nonabelian group.     Let , where . Then the relations , , , , , , and hold. The set   the group of quaternions   is a group called the Group quaternion Quaternions quaternion group . Notice that is noncommutative.    Let be the set of nonzero complex numbers.   the multiplicative group of complex numbers  Under the operation of multiplication forms a group. The identity is . If is a nonzero complex number, then is the inverse of . It is easy to see that the remaining group axioms hold.   A group is finite , Group finite or has finite order , if it contains a finite number of elements; otherwise, the group is said to be infinite or to have Group infinite infinite order . The order Group order of of a finite group is the number of elements that it contains. If is a group containing elements, we write .   the order of a group  The group is a finite group of order ; the integers form an infinite group under addition, and we sometimes write .    Basic Properties of Groups    The identity element in a group is unique; that is, there exists only one element such that for all .    Suppose that and are both identities in . Then and for all . We need to show that . If we think of as the identity, then ; but if is the identity, then . Combining these two equations, we have .    Inverses in a group are also unique. If and are both inverses of an element in a group , then and . We want to show that , but . We summarize this fact in the following proposition.    If is any element in a group , then the inverse of , denoted by , is unique.      Let be a group. If , then .    Let . Then . Similarly, . But by the previous proposition, inverses are unique; hence, .      Let be a group. For any , .    Observe that . Consequently, multiplying both sides of this equation by , we have .    It makes sense to write equations with group elements and group operations. If and are two elements in a group , does there exist an element such that ? If such an does exist, is it unique? The following proposition answers both of these questions positively.    Let be a group and and be any two elements in . Then the equations and have unique solutions in .    Suppose that . We must show that such an exists. We can multiply both sides of by to find .  To show uniqueness, suppose that and are both solutions of ; then . So . The proof for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of is similar.      If is a group and , then implies and implies .    This proposition tells us that the right and left cancellation laws Cancellation law for groups are true in groups. We leave the proof as an exercise.  We can use exponential notation for groups just as we do in ordinary algebra. If is a group and , then we define . For , we define and .    In a group, the usual laws of exponents hold; that is, for all ,    for all ;     for all ;     for all . Furthermore, if is abelian, then .       We will leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise. Notice that in general, since the group may not be abelian. If the group is or , we write the group operation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively; that is, we write instead of . The laws of exponents now become    for all ;     for all ;     for all .     It is important to realize that the last statement can be made only because and are commutative groups.    Historical Note  Although the first clear axiomatic definition of a group was not given until the late 1800s, group-theoretic methods had been employed before this time in the development of many areas of mathematics, including geometry and the theory of algebraic equations.  Joseph-Louis Lagrange Lagrange, Joseph-Louis used group-theoretic methods in a 1770 1771 memoir to study methods of solving polynomial equations. Later, Évariste Galois Galois, Évariste (1811 1832) succeeded in developing the mathematics necessary to determine exactly which polynomial equations could be solved in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial. Galois' primary tool was group theory.  The study of geometry was revolutionized in 1872 when Felix Klein Klein, Felix proposed that geometric spaces should be studied by examining those properties that are invariant under a transformation of the space. Sophus Lie, Lie, Sophus a contemporary of Klein, used group theory to study solutions of partial differential equations. One of the first modern treatments of group theory appeared in William Burnside's Burnside, William  The Theory of Groups of Finite Order [1], first published in 1897.   "

  "title": "Sage",
  "body": " Sage   Many of the groups discussed in this chapter are available for study in Sage. It is important to understand that sets that form algebraic objects (groups in this chapter) are called parents in Sage, and elements of these objects are called, well, elements. So every element belongs to a parent (in other words, is contained in some set). We can ask about properties of parents (finite? order? abelian?), and we can ask about properties of individual elements (identity? inverse?). In the following we will show you how to create some of these common groups and begin to explore their properties with Sage.    Integers mod n      We would like to work with elements of Z8 . If you were to type a 6 into a compute cell right now, what would you mean? The integer , the rational number , the real number , or the complex number ? Or perhaps you really do want the integer mod ? Sage really has no idea what you mean or want. To make this clear, you can coerce  6 into Z8 with the syntax Z8(6) . Without this, Sage will treat a input number like 6 as an integer, the simplest possible interpretation in some sense. Study the following carefully, where we first work with normal integers and then with integers mod 8.           Z8 is a bit unusual as a first example, since it has two operations defined, both addition and multiplication, with addition forming a group, and multiplication not forming a group. Still, we can work with the additive portion, here forming the Cayley table for the addition.   When is a prime number, the multipicative structure (excluding zero), will also form a group.  The integers mod are very important, so Sage implements both addition and multiplication together. Groups of symmetries are a better example of how Sage implements groups, since there is just one operation present.     Groups of symmetries  The symmetries of some geometric shapes are already defined in Sage, albeit with different names. They are implemented as permutation groups which we will begin to study carefully in .  Sage uses integers to label vertices, starting the count at 1 , instead of letters. Elements by default are printed using cycle notation which we will see described carefully in . Here is an example, with both the mathematics and Sage. For the Sage part, we create the group of symmetries and then create the symmetry with coercion, followed by outputting the element in cycle notation. Then we create just the bottom row of the notation we are using for permutations.     The final list comprehension deserves comment. The .domain() method gives a list of the symbols used for the permutation group triangle and then rho2 is employed with syntax like it is a function (it is a function) to create the images that would occupy the bottom row.  With a double list comprehension we can list all six elements of the group in the bottom row format. A good exercise would be to pair up each element with its name as given in .   Different books, different authors, different software all have different ideas about the order in which to write multiplication of functions. This textbook builds on the idea of composition of functions, so that is the composition and it is natural to apply first. Sage takes the opposite view and since we write , Sage will understand that we want to do first. Neither approach is wrong, and neither is necessarily superior, they are just different and there are good arguments for either one. When you consult other books that work with permutation groups, you want to first determine which approach it takes. (Be aware that this discussion of Sage function composition is limited to permutations only regular functions in Sage compose in the order you might be familiar with from a calculus course.)  The translation here between the text and Sage will be worthwhile practice. Here we will reprise the discussion at the end of , but reverse the order on each product to compute Sage-style and exactly mirror what the text does.      Now that we understand that Sage does multiplication in reverse, we can compute the Cayley table for this group. Default behavior is to just name elements of a group as letters, a, b, c , in the same order that the .list() command would produce the elements of the group. But you can also print the elements in the table as themselves (that uses cycle notation here), or you can give the elements names. We will use u as shorthand for and r as shorthand for .     You should verify that the table above is correct, just like Table 3.2 is correct. Remember that the convention is to multiply a row label times a column label, in that order. However, to do a check across the two tables, you will need to recall the difference in ordering between your textbook and Sage.     Quaternions  Sage implements the quaternions, but the elements are not matrices, but rather are permutations. Despite appearances the structure is identical. It should not matter which version you have in mind (matrices or permutations) if you build the Cayley table and use the default behavior of using letters to name the elements. As permutations, or as letters, can you identify , , and ?    It should be fairly obvious that a is the identity element of the group ( ), either from its behavior in the table, or from its bottom row representation as the first element of the list above. And if you prefer, you can ask Sage for a list of its outputs when viewed as a function.   Now should have the property that . We see that the identity element a is on the diagonal of the Cayley table only when we compute c*c . We can verify this easily, by extracting the third element of the column headings of the Cayley table. Now that we have identified , once we locate , we can easily compute , and so on.    See if you can pair up the letters with all eight elements of the quaternions. Be a bit careful with your names, the symbol I is used by Sage for the imaginary number (which we will use below), but Sage will silently let you redefine it to be anything you like. Same goes for using lower-case i in Sage. So call your elements of the quaternions something like QI, QJ, QK to avoid confusion.  As we begin to work with groups it is instructive to work with the actual elements. But many properties of groups are totally independent of the order we use for multiplication, or the names or representations we use for the elements. Here are facts about the quaternions we can compute without any knowledge of just how the elements are written or multiplied.        Subgroups  The best techniques for creating subgroups will come in future chapters, but we can create some groups that are naturally subgroups of other groups.  Elements of the quaternions were represented by certain permutations of the integers 1 through 8. We can also build the group of all permutations of these eight integers. It gets pretty big, so do not list it unless you want a lot of output! (I dare you.)    The quaternions, Q , is a subgroup of the full group of all permutations, the symmetric group or S8 , and Sage regards this as a property of Q .   In Sage the complex numbers are known by the name CC . We can create a list of the elements in the subgroup described in . Then we can verify that this set is a subgroup by examining the Cayley table, using multiplication as the operation.     "

To add two complex numbers and , we just add the corresponding real and imaginary parts: . Remembering that , we multiply complex numbers just like polynomials. The product of and is .  Every nonzero complex number has a multiplicative inverse; that is, there exists a such that . If , then . The complex conjugate Conjugate, complex of a complex number is defined to be . The absolute value or modulus of is .   Let and . Then and . Also, .    Rectangular coordinates of a complex number    The complex plane where the horizontal axis is the x-axis or real axis and the verticle axis is the y-axis or imaginary axis. The point z1 = 2 + 3i is in the upper right quadrant, the point z2 = 1- 2i in the lower right quadrant, and z3 = -3 + 2i in the upper right quadrant.     There are several ways of graphically representing complex numbers. We can represent a complex number as an ordered pair on the plane where is the (or real) coordinate and is the (or imaginary) coordinate. This is called the rectangular or Cartesian representation. The rectangular representations of , , and are depicted in .   Polar coordinates of a complex number    The complex plane where the horizontal axis is the x-axis or real axis and the verticle axis is the y-axis or imaginary axis. The point a + bi is in the upper right quadrant. The point is also determined by a ray that at an angle of theta counterclockwise from the horizontal axis having a length of r.     Nonzero complex numbers can also be represented using polar coordinates . To specify any nonzero point on the plane, it suffices to give an angle from the positive axis in the counterclockwise direction and a distance from the origin, as in . We can see that . Hence, and . We sometimes abbreviate as .    To assure that the representation of is well-defined, we also require that . If the measurement is in radians, then .   Suppose that . Then and . Hence, the rectangular representation is .  Conversely, if we are given a rectangular representation of a complex number, it is often useful to know the number's polar representation. If , then and , so .   The polar representation of a complex number makes it easy to find products and powers of complex numbers. The proof of the following proposition is straightforward and is left as an exercise.    Let and be two nonzero complex numbers. Then .     If and , then .

Suppose that and we wish to compute . Rather than computing directly, it is much easier to switch to polar coordinates and calculate using DeMoivre's Theorem: .     The Circle Group and the Roots of Unity  The multiplicative group of the complex numbers, , possesses some interesting subgroups. Whereas and have no interesting subgroups of finite order, has many. We first consider the circle group , Group circle    the circle group   . The following proposition is a direct result of .    The circle group is a subgroup of .    Although the circle group has infinite order, it has many interesting finite subgroups. Suppose that . Then is a subgroup of the circle group. Also, , , , and are exactly those complex numbers that satisfy the equation . The complex numbers satisfying the equation are called the th root of unity th roots of unity .    If , then the th roots of unity are , where . Furthermore, the th roots of unity form a cyclic subgroup of of order     By DeMoivre's Theorem, . The 's are distinct since the numbers are all distinct and are greater than or equal to 0 but less than . The fact that these are all of the roots of the equation follows from from , which states that a polynomial of degree can have at most roots. We will leave the proof that the th roots of unity form a cyclic subgroup of as an exercise.    A generator for the group of the th roots of unity is called a Primitive th root of unity primitive th root of unity .   The 8th roots of unity can be represented as eight equally spaced points on the unit circle ( ). The primitive 8th roots of unity are .   8th roots of unity    The 8 roots of unity are spaced evenly around the unit circle beginning with 1 on the positive horizontal axis and followed by omega, i, the cube of omega, -1, omega to the fifth power, -i, and omega to the seventh power.

  "body": " Sage   Cyclic groups are very important, so it is no surprise that they appear in many different forms in Sage. Each is slightly different, and no one implementation is ideal for an introduction, but together they can illustrate most of the important ideas. Here is a guide to the various ways to construct, and study, a cyclic group in Sage.    Infinite Cyclic Groups  In Sage, the integers are constructed with ZZ . To build the infinite cyclic group such as from , simply use 3*ZZ . As an infinite set, there is not a whole lot you can do with this. You can test if integers are in this set, or not. You can also recall the generator with the .gen() command.       Additive Cyclic Groups  The additive cyclic group can be built as a special case of a more general Sage construction. First we build and capture its generator. Throughout, pay close attention to the use of parentheses and square brackets for when you experiment on your own.     You can compute in this group, by using the generator, or by using new elements formed by coercing integers into the group, or by taking the result of operations on other elements. And we can compute the order of elements in this group. Notice that we can perform repeated additions with the shortcut of taking integer multiples of an element.      We can create, and then compute with, new elements of the group by coercing an integer (in a list of length ) into the group. You may get a DeprecationWarning the first time you use this syntax if you are using an old version of Sage. The mysterious warning can be safely ignored.                It is possible to create cyclic subgroups, from an element designated to be the new generator. Unfortunately, to do this requires the .submodule() method (which should be renamed in Sage).        The cyclic subgroup H just created has more than one generator. We can test this by building a new subgroup and comparing the two subgroups.         Certainly the list of elements, and the common generator of (2) lead us to belive that H and K are the same, but the comparison in the last line leaves no doubt.  Results in this section, especially and , can be investigated by creating generators of subgroups from a generator of one additive cyclic group, creating the subgroups, and computing the orders of both elements and orders of groups.    Abstract Multiplicative Cyclic Groups  We can create an abstract cyclic group in the style of , , and . In the syntax below a is a name for the generator, and 14 is the order of the element. Notice that the notation is now multiplicative, so we multiply elements, and repeated products can be written as powers.     Computations in the group are similar to before, only with different notation. Now products, with repeated products written as exponentiation.        Subgroups can be formed with a .subgroup() command. But do not try to list the contents of a subgroup, it'll look strangely unfamiliar. Also, comparison of subgroups is not implemented.      One advantage of this implementation is the possibility to create all possible subgroups. Here we create the list of subgroups, extract one in particular (the third), and check its order.      Cyclic Permutation Groups  We will learn more about permutation groups in the next chapter. But we will mention here that it is easy to create cyclic groups as permutation groups, and a variety of methods are available for working with them, even if the actual elements get a bit cumbersome to work with. As before, notice that the notation and syntax is multiplicative.        We can create subgroups, check their orders, and list their elements.     It could help to visualize this group, and the subgroup, as rotations of a regular -gon with the vertices labeled with the integers through . This is not the full group of symmetries, since it does not include reflections, just the rotations.    Cayley Tables  As groups, each of the examples above (groups and subgroups) have Cayley tables implemented. Since the groups are cyclic, and their subgroups are therefore cyclic, the Cayley tables should have a similar cyclic pattern. Note that the letters used in the default table are generic, and are not related to the letters used above for specific elements they just match up with the group elements in the order given by .list() .   If the real names of the elements are not too complicated, the table could be more informative using these names.     Complex Roots of Unity  The finite cyclic subgroups of , generated by a primitive th root of unity are implemented as a more general construction in Sage, known as a cyclotomic field. If you concentrate on just the multiplication of powers of a generator (and ignore the infinitely many other elements) then this is a finite cyclic group. Since this is not implemented directly in Sage as a group, per se , it is a bit harder to construct things like subgroups, but it is an excellent exercise to try. It is a nice example since the complex numbers are a concrete and familiar construction. Here are a few sample calculations to provide you with some exploratory tools. See the notes following the computations.               Notes:    zeta14 is the name of the generator used for the cyclotomic field, it is a primitive root of unity (a th root of unity in this case). We have captured it as w .    The syntax CDF(w) will convert the complex number w into the more familiar form with real and imaginary parts.    The method .abs() will return the modulus of a complex number, as described in the text. For elements of this should always equal .    The method .arg() will return the argument of a complex number, as described in the text. Every element of the cyclic group in this example should have an argument that is an integer multiple of . The N() syntax converts the symbolic value of pi to a numerical approximation.     sg is a list of elements that form a cyclic subgroup of order 7, composed of the first 7 powers of b = w^2 . So, for example, the last comparison multiplies the fifth power of b with the sixth power of b , which would be the eleventh power of b . But since b has order 7, this reduces to the fourth power.    If you know a subset of an infinite group forms a subgroup, then you can produce its Cayley table by specifying the list of elements you want to use. Here we ask for a multiplication table, since that is the relevant operation.      "

  "body": " Sage Exercises   This group of exercises is about the group of units mod , , which is sometimes cyclic, sometimes not. There are some commands in Sage that will answer some of these questions very quickly, but instead of using those now, just use the basic techniques described. The idea here is to just work with elements, and lists of elements, to discern the subgroup structure of these groups.  Sage worksheets have extensive capabilities for making new cells with carefully formatted text, include support for latex syntax to express mathematics. So when a question asks for explanation or commentary, make a new cell and communicate clearly with your audience. Continue this practice in subsequent exercise sets.    Execute the statement R = Integers(40) to create the set [0,1,2,...,39] This is a group under addition mod , which we will ignore. Instead we are interested in the subset of elements which have an inverse under multiplication mod . Determine how big this subgroup is by executing the command R.unit_group_order() , and then obtain a list of these elements with R.list_of_elements_of_multiplicative_group() .    You can create elements of this group by coercing regular integers into U , such as with the statement a = U(7) . (Don't confuse this with our mathematical notation .) This will tell Sage that you want to view as an element of , subject to the corresponding operations. Determine the elements of the cyclic subgroup of generated by with a list comprehension as follows:   What is the order of in ?    The group is cyclic. Using only the Sage commands described previously, use Sage to find a generator for this group. Now using only theorems about the structure of cyclic groups, describe each of the subgroups of by specifying its order and by giving an explicit generator. Do not repeat any of the subgroups in other words, present each subgroup exactly once. You can use Sage to check your work on the subgroups, but your answer about the subgroups should rely only on theorems and be a nicely written paragraph with a table, etc.    The group is not cyclic. Again, using only the Sage commands described previously, use computations to provide irrefutable evidence of this. How many of the different subgroups of can you list?    Again, using only the Sage commands described previously, explore the structure of for various values of and see if you can formulate an interesting conjecture about some basic property of this group. (Yes, this is a very open-ended question, but this is ultimately the real power of exploring mathematics with Sage.)   "

In this case we write instead of .   the symmetric group on letters  The following theorem says that is a group. We call this group the symmetric group Group symmetric on letters.    The symmetric group on letters, , is a group with elements, where the binary operation is the composition of maps.    The identity of is just the identity map that sends to , to , , to . If is a permutation, then exists, since is one-to-one and onto; hence, every permutation has an inverse. Composition of maps is associative, which makes the group operation associative. We leave the proof that as an exercise.    A subgroup of is called a Group permutation Permutation group permutation group .   Consider the subgroup of consisting of the identity permutation and the permutations . The following table tells us how to multiply elements in the permutation group .       Though it is natural to multiply elements in a group from left to right, functions are composed from right to left. Let and be permutations on a set . To compose and as functions, we calculate . That is, we do first, then . There are several ways to approach this inconsistency. We will adopt the convention of multiplying permutations right to left. To compute , do first and then . That is, by we mean . (Another way of solving this problem would be to write functions on the right; that is, instead of writing , we could write . We could also multiply permutations left to right to agree with the usual way of multiplying elements in a group. Certainly all of these methods have been used.    Permutation multiplication is not usually commutative. Let . Then , but .     Cycle Notation  The notation that we have used to represent permutations up to this point is cumbersome, to say the least. To work effectively with permutation groups, we need a more streamlined method of writing down and manipulating permutations.  A permutation is a cycle of length Cycle definition of  if there exist elements such that and for all other elements . We will write to denote the cycle .   cycle of length  Cycles are the building blocks of all permutations.   The permutation is a cycle of length , whereas is a cycle of length .  Not every permutation is a cycle. Consider the permutation . This permutation actually contains a cycle of length 2 and a cycle of length .    It is very easy to compute products of cycles. Suppose that . If we think of as , and as , then for remembering that we apply first and then , it must be the case that , or . If , then .   Two cycles in , and , are disjoint Cycle disjoint if for all and .   The cycles and are disjoint; however, the cycles and are not. Calculating their products, we find that . The product of two cycles that are not disjoint may reduce to something less complicated; the product of disjoint cycles cannot be simplified.     Let and be two disjoint cycles in . Then .    Let and . We must show that for all . If is neither in nor , then both and fix . That is, and . Hence, . Do not forget that we are multiplying permutations right to left, which is the opposite of the order in which we usually multiply group elements. Now suppose that . Then ; that is, . However, since and are disjoint. Therefore, . Similarly, if , then and also commute.      Every permutation in can be written as the product of disjoint cycles.    We can assume that . If and we define to be , then the set is finite since is finite. Now let be the first integer in that is not in and define by . Again, is a finite set. Continuing in this manner, we can define finite disjoint sets . Since is a finite set, we are guaranteed that this process will end and there will be only a finite number of these sets, say . If is the cycle defined by , then . Since the sets are disjoint, the cycles must also be disjoint.     Let . Using cycle notation, we can write .    From this point forward we will find it convenient to use cycle notation to represent permutations. When using cycle notation, we often denote the identity permutation by .     Transpositions  The simplest permutation is a cycle of length . Such cycles are called Transposition transpositions . Since , any cycle can be written as the product of transpositions, leading to the following proposition.    Any permutation of a finite set containing at least two elements can be written as the product of transpositions.     Consider the permutation . As we can see, there is no unique way to represent permutation as the product of transpositions. For instance, we can write the identity permutation as , as , and in many other ways. However, as it turns out, no permutation can be written as the product of both an even number of transpositions and an odd number of transpositions. For instance, we could represent the permutation by or by , but will always be the product of an odd number of transpositions.     If the identity is written as the product of transpositions, , then is an even number.    We will employ induction on . A transposition cannot be the identity; hence, . If , then we are done. Suppose that . In this case the product of the last two transpositions, , must be one of the following cases: , where , , , and are distinct.  The first equation simply says that a transposition is its own inverse. If this case occurs, delete from the product to obtain . By induction is even; hence, must be even.  In each of the other three cases, we can replace with the right-hand side of the corresponding equation to obtain a new product of transpositions for the identity. In this new product the last occurrence of will be in the next-to-the-last transposition. We can continue this process with to obtain either a product of transpositions or a new product of transpositions where the last occurrence of is in . If the identity is the product of transpositions, then again we are done, by our induction hypothesis; otherwise, we will repeat the procedure with .  At some point either we will have two adjacent, identical transpositions canceling each other out or will be shuffled so that it will appear only in the first transposition. However, the latter case cannot occur, because the identity would not fix in this instance. Therefore, the identity permutation must be the product of transpositions and, again by our induction hypothesis, we are done.      If a permutation can be expressed as the product of an even number of transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling must also contain an even number of transpositions. Similarly, if can be expressed as the product of an odd number of transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling must also contain an odd number of transpositions.    Suppose that , where is even. We must show that is also an even number. The inverse of is . Since , must be even by . The proof for the case in which can be expressed as an odd number of transpositions is left as an exercise.    In light of , we define a permutation to be even Permutation even if it can be expressed as an even number of transpositions and odd Permutation odd if it can be expressed as an odd number of transpositions.    The Alternating Groups  One of the most important subgroups of is the set of all even permutations, .   the alternating group on letters  The group is called the Group alternating alternating group on letters .    The set is a subgroup of .    Since the product of two even permutations must also be an even permutation, is closed. The identity is an even permutation and therefore is in . If is an even permutation, then , where is a transposition and is even. Since the inverse of any transposition is itself, is also in .      The number of even permutations in , , is equal to the number of odd permutations; hence, the order of is .    Let be the set of even permutations in and be the set of odd permutations. If we can show that there is a bijection between these sets, they must contain the same number of elements. Fix a transposition in . Since , such a exists. Define by . Suppose that . Then and so . Therefore, is one-to-one. We will leave the proof that is surjective to the reader.     The group is the subgroup of consisting of even permutations. There are twelve elements in : . One of the end-of-chapter exercises will be to write down all the subgroups of . You will find that there is no subgroup of order 6. Does this surprise you?     Historical Note  Lagrange Lagrange, Joseph-Louis first thought of permutations as functions from a set to itself, but it was Cauchy who developed the basic theorems and notation for permutations. He was the first to use cycle notation. Augustin-Louis Cauchy Cauchy, Augustin-Louis (1789 1857) was born in Paris at the height of the French Revolution. His family soon left Paris for the village of Arcueil to escape the Reign of Terror. One of the family's neighbors there was Pierre-Simon Laplace Laplace, Pierre-Simon (1749 1827), who encouraged him to seek a career in mathematics. Cauchy began his career as a mathematician by solving a problem in geometry given to him by Lagrange. Cauchy wrote over 800 papers on such diverse topics as differential equations, finite groups, applied mathematics, and complex analysis. He was one of the mathematicians responsible for making calculus rigorous. Perhaps more theorems and concepts in mathematics have the name Cauchy attached to them than that of any other mathematician.   "

Such groups consist of the rigid motions of a regular -sided polygon or -gon. For , we define the nth dihedral group Group dihedral to be the group of rigid motions of a regular -gon. We will denote this group by .   the dihedral group  We can number the vertices of a regular -gon by ( ). Notice that there are exactly choices to replace the first vertex. If we replace the first vertex by , then the second vertex must be replaced either by vertex or by vertex ; hence, there are possible rigid motions of the -gon. We summarize these results in the following theorem.   A regular -gon   An n-gon with vertex 1 at the top, followed by 2, 3, 4, ..., n - 1, n.       The dihedral group, , is a subgroup of of order .      The group , , consists of all products of the two elements and , where has order and has order , and these two elements satisfy the relation .

Label the reflections , where is the reflection that leaves vertex fixed. There are two cases of reflections, depending on whether is even or odd. If there are an even number of vertices, then two vertices are left fixed by a reflection, and . If there are an odd number of vertices, then only a single vertex is left fixed by a reflection and are distinct ( ). In either case, the order of each is two. Let . Then and . Since any rigid motion of the -gon replaces the first vertex by the vertex , the second vertex must be replaced by either or by . If the second vertex is replaced by , then .

Types of reflections of a regular -gon   The top hexagon (1 (top), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is relected to (1 (top), 6, 5, 4, 3,. 2).

The Motion Group of a Cube  We can investigate the groups of rigid motions of geometric objects other than a regular -sided polygon to obtain interesting examples of permutation groups. Let us consider the group of rigid motions of a cube. By rigid motion, we mean a rotation with the axis of rotation about opposing faces, edges, or vertices. One of the first questions that we can ask about this group is what is its order? A cube has sides. If a particular side is facing upward, then there are four possible rotations of the cube that will preserve the upward-facing side. Hence, the order of the group is . We have just proved the following proposition.    The group of rigid motions of a cube contains elements.      The group of rigid motions of a cube is .    From , we already know that the motion group of the cube has elements, the same number of elements as there are in . There are exactly four diagonals in the cube. If we label these diagonals , , , and , we must show that the motion group of the cube will give us any permutation of the diagonals ( ). If we can obtain all of these permutations, then and the group of rigid motions of the cube must be the same. To obtain a transposition we can rotate the cube about the axis joining the midpoints of opposite edges ( ). There are six such axes, giving all transpositions in .

  "body": " Sage   A good portion of Sage's support for group theory is based on routines from GAP (Groups, Algorithms, and Programming) at www.gap-system.org , which is included in every copy of Sage. This is a mature open source package, dating back to 1986. (Forward reference here to GAP console, etc.)  As we have seen, groups can be described in many different ways, such as sets of matrices, sets of complex numbers, or sets of symbols subject to defining relations. A very concrete way to represent groups is via permutations (one-to-one and onto functions of the integers through ), using function composition as the operation in the group, as described in this chapter. Sage has many routines designed to work with groups of this type and they are also a good way for those learning group theory to gain experience with the basic ideas of group theory. For both these reasons, we will concentrate on these types of groups.    Permutation Groups and Elements  The easiest way to work with permutation group elements in Sage is to write them in cycle notation. Since these are products of disjoint cycles (which commute), we do not need to concern ourselves with the actual order of the cycles. If we write (1,3)(2,4) we probably understand it to be a permutation (the topic of this chapter!) and we know that it could be an element of , or perhaps a symmetric group on more symbols than just 4. Sage cannot get started that easily and needs a bit of context, so we coerce a string of characters written with cycle notation into a symmetric group to make group elements. Here are some examples and some sample computations. Remember that Sage and your text differ on how to interpret the order of composing two permutations in a product.    If the next three examples seem confusing, or backwards , then now would be an excellent time to review the Sage discussion about the order of permutation composition in the subsection .     There are alternate ways to create permutation group elements, which can be useful in some situations, but they are not quite as useful in everday use.         The second version of is a list of tuples , which requires a lot of commas and these must be enclosed in a list. (A tuple of length one must be written like (4,) to distinguish it from using parentheses for grouping, as in 5*(4) .) The third version uses the bottom-row of the more cumbersome two-row notation introduced at the beginning of the chapter it is an ordered list of the output values of the permutation when considered as a function.  So we then see that despite three different input procedures, all the versions of print the same way, and moreso they are actually equal to each other. (This is a subtle difference what an object is in Sage versus how an object displays itself.)  We can be even more careful about the nature of our elements. Notice that once we get Sage started, it can promote the product into the larger permutation group. We can promote elements into larger permutation groups, but it is an error to try to shoe-horn an element into a too-small symmetric group.        It is an error to try to coerce a permutation with too many symbols into a permutation group employing too few symbols.   Better than working with just elements of the symmetric group, we can create a variety of permutation groups in Sage. Here is a sampling for starters:   Some Sage permutation groups    Sage Command  Description    SymmetricGroup(n)  Permutations on symbols, elements    DihedralGroup(n)  Symmetries of an -gon, elements.    CyclicPermutationGroup(n)  Rotations of an -gon (no flips), elements    AlternatingGroup(n)  Alternating group on symbols, elements    KleinFourGroup()  A non-cyclic group of order 4      You can also locate Sage permutation groups with the groups catalog. In the next cell place your cursor right after the final dot and hit the tab-key. You will get a list of methods you can use to create permutation groups. As always, place a question-mark after a method and hit the tab-key to get online documentation of a method.     Properties of Permutation Elements  Sometimes it is easier to grab an element out of a list of elements of a permutation group, and then it is already attached to a parent and there is no need for any coercion. In the following, rotate and flip are automatically elements of G because of the way we procured them.    So we see from this final statement that the group of symmetries of a pentagon is not abelian. But there is an easier way.   There are many more methods you can use for both permutation groups and their individual elements. Use the blank compute cell below to create a permutation group (any one you like) and an element of a permutation group (any one you like). Then use tab-completion to see all the methods available for an element, or for a group (name, period, tab-key). Some names you may recognize, some we will learn about in the coming chapters, some are highly-specialized research tools you can use when you write your Ph.D. thesis in group theory. For any of these methods, remember that you can type the name, followed by a question mark, to see documentation and examples. Experiment and explore  it is really hard to break anything.   Here are some selected examples of various methods available.        A very useful method when studying the alternating group is the permutation group element method .sign() . It will return 1 if a permutation is even and -1 if a permutation is odd.    We can create subgroups by giving the main group a list of generators. These elements serve to generate a subgroup imagine multiplying these elements (and their inverses) together over and over, creating new elements that must also be in the subgroup and also become involved in new products, until you see no new elements. Now that definition ends with a horribly imprecise statement, but it should suffice for now. A better definition is that the subgroup generated by the elements is the smallest subgroup of the main group that contains all the generators which is fine if you know what all the subgroups might be.  With a single generator, the repeated products just become powers of the lone generator. The subgroup generated then is cyclic. With two (or more) generators, especially in a non-abelian group, the situation can be much, much more complicated. So let us begin with just a single generator. But do not forget to put it in a list anyway.        We can now redo the example from the very beginning of this chapter. We translate to elements to cycle notation, construct the subgroup from two generators (the subgroup is not cyclic), and since the subgroup is abelian, we do not have to view Sage's Cayley table as a diagonal reflection of the table in the example.       Motion Group of a Cube  We could mimic the example in the text and create elements of as permutations of the diagonals. A more obvious, but less insightful, construction is to view the 8 corners of the cube as the items being permuted. Then some obvious symmetries of the cube come from running an axis through the center of a side, through to the center of the opposite side, with quarter-turns or half-turns about these axes forming symmetries. With three such axes and four rotations per axis, we get 12 symmetries, except we have counted the identity permutation two extra times.  Label the four corners of the square top with through , placing in the left-front corner, and following around clockwise when viewed from above. Use through for the bottom square's corner, so that is directly below , below , etc. We will use quarter-turns, clockwise, around each axis, when viewed from above, the front, and the right.    Since we know from the discussion in the text that the symmetry group has elements, we see that our three quarter-turns are sufficient to create every symmetry. This prompts several questions which you can find in .    "

Historical Note  Joseph-Louis Lagrange Lagrange, Joseph-Louis (1736 1813), born in Turin, Italy, was of French and Italian descent. His talent for mathematics became apparent at an early age. Leonhard Euler Euler, Leonhard recognized Lagrange's abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19, communicated to Euler some work that he had done in the calculus of variations. That year he was also named a professor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. At the age of 23 he joined the Berlin Academy. Frederick the Great had written to Lagrange proclaiming that the greatest king in Europe should have the greatest mathematician in Europe at his court. For 20 years Lagrange held the position vacated by his mentor, Euler. His works include contributions to number theory, group theory, physics and mechanics, the calculus of variations, the theory of equations, and differential equations. Along with Laplace and Lavoisier, Lagrange was one of the people responsible for designing the metric system. During his life Lagrange profoundly influenced the development of mathematics, leaving much to the next generation of mathematicians in the form of examples and new problems to be solved.   "

  "body": " Sage   Sage can create all of the cosets of a subgroup, and all of the subgroups of a group. While these methods can be somewhat slow, they are in many, many ways much better than experimenting with pencil and paper, and can greatly assist us in understanding the structure of finite groups.    Cosets  Sage will create all the right (or left) cosets of a subgroup. Written mathematically, cosets are sets, and the order of the elements within the set is irrelevant. With Sage, lists are more natural, and here it is to our advantage.  Sage creates the cosets of a subgroup as a list of lists. Each inner list is a single coset. The first coset is always the coset that is the subgroup itself, and the first element of this coset is the identity. Each of the other cosets can be construed to have their first element as their representative, and if you use this element as the representative, the elements of the coset are in the same order they would be created by multiplying this representative by the elements of the first coset (the subgroup).  The keyword side can be 'right' or 'left' , and if not given, then the default is right cosets. The options refer to which side of the product has the representative. Notice that now Sage's results will be backwards compared with the text. Here is reprised, but in a slightly different order.    So if we work our way through the brackets carefully we can see the difference between the right cosets and the left cosets. Compare these cosets with the ones in the text and see that left and right are reversed. Shouldn't be a problem just keep it in mind.    If we study the bracketing, we can see that the left and right cosets are equal. Let's see what Sage thinks:   Mathematically, we need sets, but Sage is working with ordered lists, and the order matters. However, if we know our lists do not have duplicates (the .cosets() method will never produce duplicates) then we can sort the lists and a test for equality will perform as expected. The elements of a permutation group have an ordering defined for them it is not so important what this is, just that some ordering is defined. The sorted() function will take any list and return a sorted version. So for each list of cosets, we will sort the individual cosets and then sort the list of sorted cosets. This is a typical maneuver, though a bit complicated with the nested lists.     The list of all cosets can be quite long (it will include every element of the group) and can take a few seconds to complete, even for small groups. There are more sophisticated, and faster, ways to study cosets (such as just using their representatives), but to understand these techniques you also need to understand more theory.     Subgroups  Sage can compute all of the subgroups of a group. This can produce even more output than the coset method and can sometimes take much longer, depending on the structure of the group. The list is in order of the size of the subgroups, with smallest first. As a demonstration we will first compute and list all of the subgroups of a small group, and then extract just one of these subgroups from the list for some futher study.        The output of the .subgroups() method can be voluminous, so sometimes we are interested in properties of specific subgroups (as in the previous example) or broader questions of the group's subgroup structure. Here we expand on . Notice that just because Sage does not compute a subgroup of order 6 in , this is no substitute whatsoever for a proof such as given for the corollary. But the computational result emboldens us to search for the theoretical result with confidence.   So we see no subgroup of order 6 in the list of subgroups of . Notice how Lagrange's Theorem ( ) is in evidence all the subgroup orders divide , the order of . Be patient, the next subgroup computation may take a while.   Again, note Lagrange's Theorem in action. But more interestingly, has a subgroup of order 6. Four of them, to be precise. These four subgroups of order 6 are similar to each other, can you describe them simply ( before digging into the sg list for more information)? If you were curious how many subgroups has, you could simply count the number of subgroups in the sg list. The len() function does this for any list and is often an easy way to count things.      Subgroups of Cyclic Groups  Now that we are more familiar with permutation groups, and know about the .subgroups() method, we can revisit an idea from . The subgroups of a cyclic group are always cyclic, but how many are there and what are their orders?    We could do this all day, but you have Sage at your disposal, so vary the order of G by changing n and study the output across many runs. Maybe try a cyclic group of order 24 and compare with the symmetric group (above) which also has order 24. Do you feel a conjecture coming on?      Euler Phi Function  To add to our number-theoretic functions from , we note that Sage makes the Euler -function available as the function euler_phi() .   Here's an interesting experiment that you can try running several times.   Feel another conjecture coming on? Can you generalize this result?    "

These exercises do not contain much guidance, and get more challenging as they go. They are designed to explore, or confirm, results presented in this chapter or earlier chapters.   Important : You should answer each of the last three problems with a single (complicated) line of Sage that concludes by outputting True . A single line means you will have several Sage commands packaged up together in complicated ways. It does not mean several Sage commands seperated by semi-colons and typed in on a single line.

When you check integers below for divisibility, remember that range() produces plain integers, which are quite simple in their functionality.

  "body": " Private Key Cryptography  In Key single Cryptosystem single key single or private key cryptosystems Key private Cryptosystem private key the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting messages. To encrypt a plaintext message, we apply to the message some function which is kept secret, say . This function will yield an encrypted message. Given the encrypted form of the message, we can recover the original message by applying the inverse transformation . The transformation must be relatively easy to compute, as must ; however, must be extremely difficult to guess from available examples of coded messages.   One of the first and most famous private key cryptosystems was the shift code used by Julius Caesar. We first digitize the alphabet by letting . The encoding function will be that is, . The decoding function is then . Suppose we receive the encoded message DOJHEUD. To decode this message, we first digitize it: . Next we apply the inverse transformation to get , or ALGEBRA. Notice here that there is nothing special about either of the numbers or . We could have used a larger alphabet or a different shift.    Cryptanalysis Cryptanalysis is concerned with deciphering a received or intercepted message. Methods from probability and statistics are great aids in deciphering an intercepted message; for example, the frequency analysis of the characters appearing in the intercepted message often makes its decryption possible.   Suppose we receive a message that we know was encrypted by using a shift transformation on single letters of the -letter alphabet. To find out exactly what the shift transformation was, we must compute in the equation . We can do this using frequency analysis. The letter is the most commonly occurring letter in the English language. Suppose that is the most commonly occurring letter in the ciphertext. Then we have good reason to suspect that , or . Therefore, the most likely encrypting function is . The corresponding decrypting function is . It is now easy to determine whether or not our guess is correct.   Simple shift codes are examples of Cryptosystem monoalphabetic monoalphabetic cryptosystems . In these ciphers a character in the enciphered message represents exactly one character in the original message. Such cryptosystems are not very sophisticated and are quite easy to break. In fact, in a simple shift as described in , there are only possible keys. It would be quite easy to try them all rather than to use frequency analysis.  Let us investigate a slightly more sophisticated cryptosystem. Suppose that the encoding function is given by . We first need to find out when a decoding function exists. Such a decoding function exists when we can solve the equation for . By , this is possible exactly when has an inverse or, equivalently, when . In this case . Such a cryptosystem is called an Cryptosystem affine affine cryptosystem .   Let us consider the affine cryptosystem . For this cryptosystem to work we must choose an that is invertible. This is only possible if . Recognizing this fact, we will let since . It is easy to see that . Therefore, we can take our encryption function to be . Thus, ALGEBRA is encoded as , or DGHXIKD. The decryption function will be .   A cryptosystem would be more secure if a ciphertext letter could represent more than one plaintext letter. To give an example of this type of cryptosystem, called a polyalphabetic cryptosystem , Cryptosystem polyalphabetic we will generalize affine codes by using matrices. The idea works roughly the same as before; however, instead of encrypting one letter at a time we will encrypt pairs of letters. We can store a pair of letters and in a vector . Let be a invertible matrix with entries in . We can define an encoding function by , where is a fixed column vector and matrix operations are performed in . The decoding function must be .   Suppose that we wish to encode the word HELP. The corresponding digit string is . If , then . If , then our message is encrypted as RRGR. The encrypted letter R represents more than one plaintext letter.   Frequency analysis can still be performed on a polyalphabetic cryptosystem, because we have a good understanding of how pairs of letters appear in the English language. The pair th appears quite often; the pair qz never appears. To avoid decryption by a third party, we must use a larger matrix than the one we used in .   "

  "title": "Public Key Cryptography",
  "body": " Public Key Cryptography   If traditional cryptosystems are used, anyone who knows enough to encode a message will also know enough to decode an intercepted message. In 1976, W. Diffie Diffie, W. and M. Hellman Hellman, M. proposed public key cryptography, which is based on the observation that the encryption and decryption procedures need not have the same key. This removes the requirement that the encoding key be kept secret. The encoding function must be relatively easy to compute, but must be extremely difficult to compute without some additional information, so that someone who knows only the encrypting key cannot find the decrypting key without prohibitive computation. It is interesting to note that to date, no system has been proposed that has been proven to be one-way; that is, for any existing public key cryptosystem, it has never been shown to be computationally prohibitive to decode messages with only knowledge of the encoding key.    The RSA Cryptosystem  The RSA cryptosystem introduced by R. Rivest, Rivest, R. A. Shamir, Shamir, A. and L. Adleman Adleman, L. in 1978, is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Though it is not a difficult task to find two large random primes and multiply them together, factoring a 150-digit number that is the product of two large primes would take 100 million computers operating at 10 million instructions per second about 50 million years under the fastest algorithms available in the early 1990s. Although the algorithms have improved, factoring a number that is a product of two large primes is still computationally prohibitive.  The RSA cryptosystem RSA cryptosystem Cryptosystem RSA works as follows. Suppose that we choose two random 150-digit prime numbers and . Next, we compute the product and also compute , where is the Euler -function. Now we start choosing random integers until we find one that is relatively prime to ; that is, we choose such that . Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find a number such that . The numbers and are now made public.  Suppose now that person B (Bob) wishes to send person A (Alice) a message over a public line. Since and are known to everyone, anyone can encode messages. Bob first digitizes the message according to some scheme, say . If necessary, he will break the message into pieces such that each piece is a positive integer less than . Suppose is one of the pieces. Bob forms the number and sends to Alice. For Alice to recover , she need only compute . Only Alice knows .   Before exploring the theory behind the RSA cryptosystem or attempting to use large integers, we will use some small integers just to see that the system does indeed work. Suppose that we wish to send some message, which when digitized is . Let and . Then and . We can let , since . The encoded message is computed to be . This computation can be reasonably done by using the method of repeated squares as described in . Using the Euclidean algorithm, we determine that ; therefore, the decrypting key is . We can recover the original message by calculating .     Now let us examine why the RSA cryptosystem works. We know that ; hence, there exists a such that . There are two cases to consider. In the first case assume that . Then by , . So we see that Alice recovers the original message when she computes .  For the other case, assume that . Since and , we know is a multiple of or a multiple of , but not both. We will describe the first possibility only, since the second is entirely similar. There is then an integer , with and . Note that we have and that . Then, using , but now mod , . So there is an integer such that . Thus, Alice also recovers the message in this case, .    We can now ask how one would go about breaking the RSA cryptosystem. To find given and , we simply need to factor and solve for by using the Euclidean algorithm. If we had known that in , we could have recovered .    Message Verification  There is a problem of message verification in public key cryptosystems. Since the encoding key is public knowledge, anyone has the ability to send an encoded message. If Alice receives a message from Bob, she would like to be able to verify that it was Bob who actually sent the message. Suppose that Bob's encrypting key is and his decrypting key is . Also, suppose that Alice's encrypting key is and her decrypting key is . Since encryption keys are public information, they can exchange coded messages at their convenience. Bob wishes to assure Alice that the message he is sending is authentic. Before Bob sends the message to Alice, he decrypts with his own key: . Anyone can change back to just by encryption, but only Bob has the ability to form . Now Bob encrypts with Alice's encryption key to form , a message that only Alice can decode. Alice decodes the message and then encodes the result with Bob's key to read the original message, a message that could have only been sent by Bob.    Historical Note  Encrypting secret messages goes as far back as ancient Greece and Rome. As we know, Julius Caesar used a simple shift code to send and receive messages. However, the formal study of encoding and decoding messages probably began with the Arabs in the 1400s. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries mathematicians such as Alberti and Viete discovered that monoalphabetic cryptosystems offered no real security. In the 1800s, F. W. Kasiski established methods for breaking ciphers in which a ciphertext letter can represent more than one plaintext letter, if the same key was used several times. This discovery led to the use of cryptosystems with keys that were used only a single time. Cryptography was placed on firm mathematical foundations by such people as W. Friedman and L. Hill in the early part of the twentieth century.  The period after World War I saw the development of special-purpose machines for encrypting and decrypting messages, and mathematicians were very active in cryptography during World War II. Efforts to penetrate the cryptosystems of the Axis nations were organized in England and in the United States by such notable mathematicians as Alan Turing and A. A. Albert. The Allies gained a tremendous advantage in World War II by breaking the ciphers produced by the German Enigma machine and the Japanese Purple ciphers.  By the 1970s, interest in commercial cryptography had begun to take hold. There was a growing need to protect banking transactions, computer data, and electronic mail. In the early 1970s, IBM developed and implemented LUZIFER , the forerunner of the National Bureau of Standards' Data Encryption Standard (DES).  The concept of a public key cryptosystem, due to Diffie and Hellman, is very recent (1976). It was further developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman with the RSA cryptosystem (1978). It is not known how secure any of these systems are. The trapdoor knapsack cryptosystem, developed by Merkle and Hellman, has been broken. It is still an open question whether or not the RSA system can be broken. In 1991, RSA Laboratories published a list of semiprimes (numbers with exactly two prime factors) with a cash prize for whoever was able to provide a factorization ( http:\/\/www.emc.com\/emc-plus\/rsa-labs\/historical\/the-rsa-challenge-numbers.htm ). Although the challenge ended in 2007, many of these numbers have not yet been factored.  There been a great deal of controversy about research in cryptography and cryptography itself. In 1929, when Henry Stimson, Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover, dismissed the Black Chamber (the State Department's cryptography division) on the ethical grounds that gentlemen do not read each other's mail. During the last two decades of the twentieth century, the National Security Agency wanted to keep information about cryptography secret, whereas the academic community fought for the right to publish basic research. Currently, research in mathematical cryptography and computational number theory is very active, and mathematicians are free to publish their results in these areas.   "

  "body": " Sage   Since Sage began as software to support research in number theory, we can quickly and easily demonstrate the internal workings of the RSA algorithm. Recognize that, in practice, many other details such as encoding between letters and integers, or protecting one's private key, are equally important for the security of communications. So RSA itself is just the theoretical foundation.    Constructing Keys  We will suppose that Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob, along with message verification (also known as a message with a digital signature). So we begin with the construction of key pairs (private and public) for both Alice and Bob. We first need two large primes for both individuals, and their product. In practice, values of would have hundreds of digits, rather than just as we have done here.   Computationally, the value of the Euler -function for a product of primes can be obtained from , but we could use Sage's built-in function just as well.   Now we can create the encryption and decryption exponents. We choose the encryption exponent as a (small) number relatively prime to the value of . With Sage we can factor quickly to help us choose this value. In practice we would not want to do this computation for large values of , so we might more easily choose random values and check for the first value which is relatively prime to . The decryption exponent is the multiplicative inverse, mod , of the encryption exponent. If you construct an improper encryption exponent (not relatively prime to ), the computation of the multiplicative inverse will fail (and Sage will tell you so). We do this twice - for both Alice and Bob.      At this stage, each individual would publish their values of and , while keeping very private and secure. In practice should be protected on the user's hard disk by a password only the owner knows. For even greater security a person might only have two copies of their private key, one on a USB memory stick they always carry with them, and a backup in their sage deposit box. Every time the person uses they would need to provide the password. The value of can be discarded. For the record, here are all the keys:         Signing and Encoding a Message  Alice is going to construct a message as an English word with four letters. From these four letters we will construct a single number to represent the message in a form we can use in the RSA algorithm. The function ord() will convert a single letter to its ASCII code value, a number between 0 and 127. If we use these numbers as digits mod 128, we can be sure that Alice's four-letter word will encode to an integer less than . The particular maximum value is not important, so long as it is smaller than our value of since all of our subsequent arithmetic is mod . We choose a popular four-letter word, convert to ASCII  digits with a list comprehension, and then construct the integer from the digits with the right base. Notice how we can treat the word as a list and that the first digit in the list is in the ones place (we say the list is in little-endian order).    First, Alice will sign her message to provide message verification. She uses her private key for this, since this is an act that only she should be able to perform.   Then Alice encrypts her message so that only Bob can read it. To do this, she uses Bob's public key. Notice how she does not have to even know Bob for example, she could have obtained Bob's public key off his web site or maybe Bob announced his public key in an advertisement in the New York Times .   Alice's communication is now ready to travel on any communications network, no matter how insecure the network may be, and no matter how many snoops may be monitoring the network.     Decoding and Verifying a Message  Now assume that the value of encrypted has reached Bob. Realize that Bob may not know Alice, and realize that Bob does not even necessarily believe what he has received has genuinely originated from Alice. An adversary could be trying to confuse Bob by sending messages that claim to be from Alice. First, Bob must unwrap the encyption Alice has provided. This is an act only Bob, as the intended recipient, should be able to do. And he does it by using his private key, which only he knows, and which he has kept secure.   Right now, this means very little to Bob. Anybody could have sent him an encoded message. However, this was a message Alice signed. Lets unwrap the message signing. Notice that this uses Alice's public key. Bob does not need to know Alice for example, he could obtain Alice's key off her web site or maybe Alice announced her public key in an advertisement in the New York Times .   Bob needs to transform this integer representation back to a word with letters. The chr() function converts ASCII code values to letters, and we use a list comprehension to do this repeatedly.   If we would like a slightly more recognizable result, we can combine the letters into a string.   Bob is pleased to obtain such an informative message from Alice. What would have happened if an imposter had sent a message ostensibly from Alice, or what if an adversary had intercepted Alice's original message and replaced it with a tampered message? (The latter is known as a man in the middle attack.)  In either case, the rogue party would not be able to duplicate Alice's first action signing her message. If an adversary somehow signs the message, or tampers with it, the step where Bob unwraps the signing will lead to total garbage. (Try it!) Because Bob received a legitimate word, properly capitalized, he has confidence that the message he unsigned is the same as the message Alice signed. In practice, if Alice sent several hundred words as her message, the odds that it will unsign as cohrent text are astronomically small.  What have we demonstrated?    Alice can send messages that only Bob can read.    Bob can receive secret messages from anybody.    Alice can sign messages, so that then Bob (or anybody else)knows they are genuinely from Alice.    Of course, without making new keys, you can reverse the roles of Alice and Bob. And if Carol makes a key pair, she can communicate with both Alice and Bob in the same fashion.  If you want to use RSA public-key encryption seriously, investigate the open source software GNU Privacy Guard, aka GPG , which is freely available at www.gnupg.org\/ . Notice that it only makes sense to use encryption programs that allow you to look at the source code.    "

  "body": " Error-Detecting and Correcting Codes   Let us examine a simple model of a communications system for transmitting and receiving coded messages ( ).   Encoding and decoding messages    A vertical flow chart where an m-digit message is passed to an encoder which is represented by a rectangle to become an n-digit codeword which is passed to a transmitter that is also represented by a rectangle. The outcome of the transmitter may have noise and is passed to the receiver which is prepresented by a rectangle. The receiver passes an n-digit received word to a decoder that is represented by a rectangle. The decoder produces an m-digit received word or an error.     Uncoded messages may be composed of letters or characters, but typically they consist of binary -tuples. These messages are encoded into codewords, consisting of binary -tuples, by a device called an encoder . The message is transmitted and then decoded. We will consider the occurrence of errors during transmission. An error occurs if there is a change in one or more bits in the codeword. A decoding scheme is a method that either converts an arbitrarily received -tuple into a meaningful decoded message or gives an error message for that -tuple. If the received message is a codeword (one of the special -tuples allowed to be transmitted), then the decoded message must be the unique message that was encoded into the codeword. For received non-codewords, the decoding scheme will give an error indication, or, if we are more clever, will actually try to correct the error and reconstruct the original message. Our goal is to transmit error-free messages as cheaply and quickly as possible.   One possible coding scheme would be to send a message several times and to compare the received copies with one another. Suppose that the message to be encoded is a binary -tuple . The message is encoded into a binary -tuple by simply repeating the message three times: . To decode the message, we choose as the th digit the one that appears in the th place in at least two of the three transmissions. For example, if the original message is , then the transmitted message will be . If there is a transmission error in the fifth digit, then the received codeword will be , which will be correctly decoded as . We will adopt the convention that bits are numbered left to right in binary -tuples. This triple-repetition method will automatically detect and correct all single errors, but it is slow and inefficient: to send a message consisting of bits, extra bits are required, and we can only detect and correct single errors. We will see that it is possible to find an encoding scheme that will encode a message of bits into bits with much smaller than .     Even parity , a commonly used coding scheme, is much more efficient than the simple repetition scheme. The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) coding system uses binary -tuples, yielding possible -tuples. However, only seven bits are needed since there are only  ASCII characters. What can or should be done with the extra bit? Using the full eight bits, we can detect single transmission errors. For example, the ASCII codes for A, B, and C are . Notice that the leftmost bit is always set to 0; that is, the  ASCII characters have codes . The bit can be used for error checking on the other seven bits. It is set to either or so that the total number of bits in the representation of a character is even. Using even parity, the codes for A, B, and C now become . Suppose an A is sent and a transmission error in the sixth bit is caused by noise over the communication channel so that is received. We know an error has occurred since the received word has an odd number of s, and we can now request that the codeword be transmitted again. When used for error checking, the leftmost bit is called a parity check bit .  By far the most common error-detecting codes used in computers are based on the addition of a parity bit. Typically, a computer stores information in -tuples called words . Common word lengths are , , and bits. One bit in the word is set aside as the parity check bit, and is not used to store information. This bit is set to either or , depending on the number of s in the word.  Adding a parity check bit allows the detection of all single errors because changing a single bit either increases or decreases the number of s by one, and in either case the parity has been changed from even to odd, so the new word is not a codeword. (We could also construct an error detection scheme based on odd parity ; that is, we could set the parity check bit so that a codeword always has an odd number of s.)   The even parity system is easy to implement, but has two drawbacks. First, multiple errors are not detectable. Suppose an A is sent and the first and seventh bits are changed from to . The received word is a codeword, but will be decoded into a C instead of an A. Second, we do not have the ability to correct errors. If the 8-tuple is received, we know that an error has occurred, but we have no idea which bit has been changed. We will now investigate a coding scheme that will not only allow us to detect transmission errors but will actually correct the errors.   Suppose that our original message is either a or a , and that encodes to and encodes to . If only a single error occurs during transmission, we can detect and correct the error. For example, if a is received, then the second bit must have been changed from a to a . The originally transmitted codeword must have been . This method will detect and correct all single errors.   A repetition code             Transmitted  Received Word    Codeword                                   In , we present all possible words that might be received for the transmitted codewords and . also shows the number of bits by which each received -tuple differs from each original codeword.     Maximum-Likelihood Decoding    The coding scheme presented in is not a complete solution to the problem because it does not account for the possibility of multiple errors. For example, either a (000) or a (111) could be sent and a (001) received. We have no means of deciding from the received word whether there was a single error in the third bit or two errors, one in the first bit and one in the second. No matter what coding scheme is used, an incorrect message could be received. We could transmit a (000), have errors in all three bits, and receive the codeword (111). It is important to make explicit assumptions about the likelihood and distribution of transmission errors so that, in a particular application, it will be known whether a given error detection scheme is appropriate. We will assume that transmission errors are rare, and, that when they do occur, they occur independently in each bit; that is, if is the probability of an error in one bit and is the probability of an error in a different bit, then the probability of errors occurring in both of these bits at the same time is . We will also assume that a received -tuple is decoded into a codeword that is closest to it; that is, we assume that the receiver uses Maximum-likelihood decoding maximum-likelihood decoding . This section requires a knowledge of probability, but can be skipped without loss of continuity.   Binary symmetric channel    A schematic diagram where a zero has probabilty p that it will be decoded as a zero and probability q that it will be decoded as a one, which are represented by arrows from 0 to 0 and 1 to 1, respectively. A one has probabilty p that it will be decoded as a one and probability q that it will be decoded as a zero, which are represented by arrows from 1 to 1 and 0 to 1, respectively.     A binary symmetric channel Binary symmetric channel is a model that consists of a transmitter capable of sending a binary signal, either a or a , together with a receiver. Let be the probability that the signal is correctly received. Then is the probability of an incorrect reception. If a is sent, then the probability that a is received is and the probability that a is received is ( ). The probability that no errors occur during the transmission of a binary codeword of length is . For example, if and a message consisting of 10,000 bits is sent, then the probability of a perfect transmission is .    If a binary -tuple is transmitted across a binary symmetric channel with probability that no error will occur in each coordinate, then the probability that there are errors in exactly coordinates is .    Fix different coordinates. We first compute the probability that an error has occurred in this fixed set of coordinates. The probability of an error occurring in a particular one of these coordinates is ; the probability that an error will not occur in any of the remaining coordinates is . The probability of each of these independent events is . The number of possible error patterns with exactly errors occurring is equal to , the number of combinations of things taken at a time. Each of these error patterns has probability of occurring; hence, the probability of all of these error patterns is .     Suppose that and a -bit message is sent. The probability that the message was sent error-free is . The probability of exactly one error occurring is . The probability of exactly two errors is . The probability of more than two errors is approximately .     Block Codes  If we are to develop efficient error-detecting and error-correcting codes, we will need more sophisticated mathematical tools. Group theory will allow faster methods of encoding and decoding messages. A code is an - block code if the information that is to be coded can be divided into blocks of binary digits, each of which can be encoded into binary digits. More specifically, an -block code consists of an encoding function  and a decoding function  . A codeword is any element in the image of . We also require that be one-to-one so that two information blocks will not be encoded into the same codeword. If our code is to be error-correcting, then must be onto.   The even-parity coding system developed to detect single errors in ASCII characters is an -block code. The encoding function is , where with addition in .   Let and be binary -tuples. The Hamming distance Hamming distance or distance , , between and is the number of bits in which and differ. The distance between two codewords is the minimum number of transmission errors required to change one codeword into the other. The minimum distance Code minimum distance of for a code, , is the minimum of all distances , where and are distinct codewords. The Weight of a codeword weight , , of a binary codeword is the number of s in . Clearly, , where .   Hamming distance between and     the minimum distance of a code     the weight of     Let , , and be all of the codewords in some code . Then we have the following Hamming distances: . The minimum distance for this code is 3. We also have the following weights: .   The following proposition lists some basic properties about the weight of a codeword and the distance between two codewords. The proof is left as an exercise.    Let , , and be binary -tuples. Then    ;     ;     exactly when ;     ;     .       The weights in a particular code are usually much easier to compute than the Hamming distances between all codewords in the code. If a code is set up carefully, we can use this fact to our advantage.  Suppose that and are codewords in some code. If we transmit and an error occurs in the rightmost bit, then (1100) will be received. Since is a codeword, the decoder will decode as the transmitted message. This code is clearly not very appropriate for error detection. The problem is that . If and are codewords, then . If is transmitted and a single error occurs, then can never be received. gives the distances between all 4-bit codewords in which the first three bits carry information and the fourth is an even parity check bit. We can see that the minimum distance here is ; hence, the code is suitable as a single error-detecting code.   Distances between 4-bit codewords                                                                                                        To determine exactly what the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities for a code are, we need to analyze the minimum distance for the code. Let and be codewords. If and an error occurs where and differ, then is changed to . The received codeword is and no error message is given. Now suppose . Then a single error cannot change to . Therefore, if , we have the ability to detect single errors. However, suppose that , is sent, and a noncodeword is received such that . Then the decoder cannot decide between and . Even though we are aware that an error has occurred, we do not know what the error is.  Suppose . Then the maximum-likelihood decoding scheme corrects all single errors. Starting with a codeword , an error in the transmission of a single bit gives with , but for any other codeword . If we do not require the correction of errors, then we can detect multiple errors when a code has a minimum distance that is greater than or equal to .    Let be a code with . Then can correct any or fewer errors. Furthermore, any or fewer errors can be detected in .    Suppose that a codeword is sent and the word is received with at most errors. Then . If is any codeword other than , then . Hence, and will be correctly decoded as . Now suppose that is transmitted and is received and that at least one error has occurred, but not more than errors. Then . Since the minimum distance between codewords is , cannot be a codeword. Consequently, the code can detect between and errors.     In , the codewords , , , and determine a single error-correcting code.   Hamming distances for an error-correcting code                                           Historical Note  Modern coding theory began in 1948 with C. Shannon's Shannon, C. paper, A Mathematical Theory of Information [7]. This paper offered an example of an algebraic code, and Shannon's Theorem proclaimed exactly how good codes could be expected to be. Richard Hamming Hamming, R. began working with linear codes at Bell Labs in the late 1940s and early 1950s after becoming frustrated because the programs that he was running could not recover from simple errors generated by noise. Coding theory has grown tremendously in the past several decades. The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes , by MacWilliams and Sloane [5], published in 1977, already contained over 1500 references. Linear codes (Reed-Muller -block codes) were used on NASA's Mariner space probes. More recent space probes such as Voyager have used what are called convolution codes. Currently, very active research is being done with Goppa codes, which are heavily dependent on algebraic geometry.   "

The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) coding system uses binary -tuples, yielding possible -tuples. However, only seven bits are needed since there are only  ASCII characters. What can or should be done with the extra bit? Using the full eight bits, we can detect single transmission errors. For example, the ASCII codes for A, B, and C are . Notice that the leftmost bit is always set to 0; that is, the  ASCII characters have codes . The bit can be used for error checking on the other seven bits. It is set to either or so that the total number of bits in the representation of a character is even. Using even parity, the codes for A, B, and C now become . Suppose an A is sent and a transmission error in the sixth bit is caused by noise over the communication channel so that is received. We know an error has occurred since the received word has an odd number of s, and we can now request that the codeword be transmitted again. When used for error checking, the leftmost bit is called a parity check bit .  By far the most common error-detecting codes used in computers are based on the addition of a parity bit. Typically, a computer stores information in -tuples called words . Common word lengths are , , and bits. One bit in the word is set aside as the parity check bit, and is not used to store information. This bit is set to either or , depending on the number of s in the word.  Adding a parity check bit allows the detection of all single errors because changing a single bit either increases or decreases the number of s by one, and in either case the parity has been changed from even to odd, so the new word is not a codeword. (We could also construct an error detection scheme based on odd parity ; that is, we could set the parity check bit so that a codeword always has an odd number of s.)  "

One way to accomplish this is to require that the code also be a group. A group code Code group is a code that is also a subgroup of .  To check that a code is a group code, we need only verify one thing. If we add any two elements in the code, the result must be an -tuple that is again in the code. It is not necessary to check that the inverse of the -tuple is in the code, since every codeword is its own inverse, nor is it necessary to check that is a codeword. For instance, .   Suppose that we have a code that consists of the following 7-tuples: . It is a straightforward though tedious task to verify that this code is also a subgroup of and, therefore, a group code. This code is a single error-detecting and single error-correcting code, but it is a long and tedious process to compute all of the distances between pairs of codewords to determine that . It is much easier to see that the minimum weight of all the nonzero codewords is . As we will soon see, this is no coincidence. However, the relationship between weights and distances in a particular code is heavily dependent on the fact that the code is a group.     Let and be binary -tuples. Then .    Suppose that and are binary -tuples. Then the distance between and is exactly the number of places in which and differ.

Let be the minimum distance for a group code . Then is the minimum weight of all the nonzero codewords in . That is, .    Observe that .      Linear Codes  From , it is now easy to check that the minimum nonzero weight is ; hence, the code does indeed detect and correct all single errors. We have now reduced the problem of finding good codes to that of generating group codes. One easy way to generate group codes is to employ a bit of matrix theory.  Define the inner product Inner product of two binary -tuples to be , where and are column vectors. Since we will be working with matrices, we will write binary -tuples as column vectors for the remainder of this chapter. For example, if and , then . We can also look at an inner product as the product of a row matrix with a column matrix; that is, .   Suppose that the words to be encoded consist of all binary -tuples and that our encoding scheme is even-parity. To encode an arbitrary -tuple, we add a fourth bit to obtain an even number of s. Notice that an arbitrary -tuple has an even number of s exactly when ; hence, a -tuple has an even number of s if , or . This example leads us to hope that there is a connection between matrices and coding theory.   Let denote the set of all matrices with entries in .

  "body": " Parity-Check and Generator Matrices  We need to find a systematic way of generating linear codes as well as fast methods of decoding. By examining the properties of a matrix and by carefully choosing , it is possible to develop very efficient methods of encoding and decoding messages. To this end, we will introduce standard generator and canonical parity-check matrices.  Suppose that is an matrix with entries in and . If the last columns of the matrix form the identity matrix, , then the matrix is a Matrix parity-check canonical parity-check matrix . More specifically, , where is the matrix and is the identity matrix . With each canonical parity-check matrix we can associate an  standard generator matrix Matrix generator  . Our goal will be to show that an satisfying exists if and only if . Given a message block to be encoded, the matrix will allow us to quickly encode it into a linear codeword .   Suppose that we have the following eight words to be encoded: . For , the associated standard generator and canonical parity-check matrices are and , respectively.  Observe that the rows in represent the parity checks on certain bit positions in a -tuple. The s in the identity matrix serve as parity checks for the s in the same row. If , then , which yields a system of equations: . Here serves as a check bit for and ; is a check bit for and ; and is a check bit for and . The identity matrix keeps , , and from having to check on each other. Hence, , , and can be arbitrary but , , and must be chosen to ensure parity. The null space of is easily computed to be An even easier way to compute the null space is with the generator matrix ( ).    A matrix-generated code    Message Word  Codeword                                       If is a canonical parity-check matrix, then consists of all whose first bits are arbitrary but whose last bits are determined by . Each of the last bits serves as an even parity check bit for some of the first bits. Hence, gives rise to an -block code.    We leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise. In light of the theorem, the first bits in are called information bits and the last bits are called check bits . In , the first three bits are the information bits and the last three are the check bits.    Suppose that is an standard generator matrix. Then is an -block code. More specifically, is a group code.    Let and be two codewords. Then is in since . We must also show that two message blocks cannot be encoded into the same codeword. That is, we must show that if , then . Suppose that . Then . However, the first coordinates in are exactly , since they are determined by the identity matrix, , part of . Hence, exactly when .    Before we can prove the relationship between canonical parity-check matrices and standard generating matrices, we need to prove a lemma.    Let be an canonical parity-check matrix and be the corresponding standard generator matrix. Then .    Let . The th entry in is , where is the Kronecker delta Kronecker delta.   Kronecker delta        Let be an canonical parity-check matrix and let be the standard generator matrix associated with . Let be the code generated by . Then is in if and only if . In particular, is a linear code with canonical parity-check matrix .    First suppose that . Then for some . By , .  Conversely, suppose that is in the null space of . We need to find an in such that . Since , the following set of equations must be satisfied: . Equivalently, are determined by : . Consequently, we can let for .    It would be helpful if we could compute the minimum distance of a linear code directly from its matrix in order to determine the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities of the code. Suppose that are the -tuples in of weight . For an binary matrix , is exactly the th column of the matrix .   Observe that .   We state this result in the following proposition and leave the proof as an exercise.    Let be the binary -tuple with a in the th coordinate and 's elsewhere and suppose that . Then is the th column of the matrix .      Let be an binary matrix. Then the null space of is a single error-detecting code if and only if no column of consists entirely of zeros.    Suppose that is a single error-detecting code. Then the minimum distance of the code must be at least . Since the null space is a group code, it is sufficient to require that the code contain no codewords of less than weight other than the zero codeword. That is, must not be a codeword for . Since is the th column of , the only way in which could be in the null space of would be if the th column were all zeros, which is impossible; hence, the code must have the capability to detect at least single errors.  Conversely, suppose that no column of is the zero column. By , .     If we consider the matrices and , then the null space of is a single error-detecting code and the null space of is not.   We can even do better than . This theorem gives us conditions on a matrix that tell us when the minimum weight of the code formed by the null space of is . We can also determine when the minimum distance of a linear code is by examining the corresponding matrix.   If we let and want to determine whether or not is the canonical parity-check matrix for an error-correcting code, it is necessary to make certain that does not contain any -tuples of weight . That is, , , , , , and must not be in . The next theorem states that we can indeed determine that the code generated by is error-correcting by examining the columns of . Notice in this example that not only does have no zero columns, but also that no two columns are the same.     Let be a binary matrix. The null space of is a single error-correcting code if and only if does not contain any zero columns and no two columns of are identical.    The -tuple has s in the th and th entries and 0s elsewhere, and for . Since can only occur if the th and th columns are identical, the null space of is a single error-correcting code.    Suppose now that we have a canonical parity-check matrix with three rows. Then we might ask how many more columns we can add to the matrix and still have a null space that is a single error-detecting and single error-correcting code. Since each column has three entries, there are possible distinct columns. We cannot add the columns . So we can add as many as four columns and still maintain a minimum distance of .  In general, if is an canonical parity-check matrix, then there are information positions in each codeword. Each column has bits, so there are possible distinct columns. It is necessary that the columns be excluded, leaving remaining columns for information if we are still to maintain the ability not only to detect but also to correct single errors.    "

  "body": " Efficient Decoding   We are now at the stage where we are able to generate linear codes that detect and correct errors fairly easily, but it is still a time-consuming process to decode a received -tuple and determine which is the closest codeword, because the received -tuple must be compared to each possible codeword to determine the proper decoding. This can be a serious impediment if the code is very large.   Given the binary matrix and the -tuples and , we can compute . Hence, is a codeword and is not, since is in the null space and is not. Notice that is identical to the first column of . In fact, this is where the error occurred. If we flip the first bit in from to , then we obtain .     If is an matrix and , then we say that the syndrome Syndrome of a code of is . The following proposition allows the quick detection and correction of errors.    Let the binary matrix determine a linear code and let be the received -tuple. Write as , where is the transmitted codeword and is the transmission error. Then the syndrome of the received codeword is also the syndrome of the error .    The proof follows from the fact that .     This proposition tells us that the syndrome of a received word depends solely on the error and not on the transmitted codeword. The proof of the following theorem follows immediately from and from the fact that is the th column of the matrix .    Let and suppose that the linear code corresponding to is single error-correcting. Let be a received -tuple that was transmitted with at most one error. If the syndrome of is , then no error has occurred; otherwise, if the syndrome of is equal to some column of , say the th column, then the error has occurred in the th bit.     Consider the matrix and suppose that the -tuples , , and have been received. Then . Hence, has an error in the third bit and has an error in the fourth bit. The transmitted codewords for and must have been and , respectively. The syndrome of does not occur in any of the columns of the matrix , so multiple errors must have occurred to produce .     Coset Decoding  We can use group theory to obtain another way of decoding messages. A linear code is a subgroup of . Coset Coset decoding or standard decoding Standard decoding uses the cosets of in to implement maximum-likelihood decoding. Suppose that is an -linear code. A coset of in is written in the form , where . By Lagrange's Theorem ( ), there are distinct cosets of in .   Let be the -linear code given by the parity-check matrix . The code consists of the codewords . There are cosets of in , each with order . These cosets are listed in .    Cosets of    Coset  Coset    Representative                                      Our task is to find out how knowing the cosets might help us to decode a message. Suppose that was the original codeword sent and that is the -tuple received. If is the transmission error, then or, equivalently, . However, this is exactly the statement that is an element in the coset . In maximum-likelihood decoding we expect the error to be as small as possible; that is, will have the least weight. An -tuple of least weight in a coset is called a Coset leader coset leader . Once we have determined a coset leader for each coset, the decoding process becomes a task of calculating to obtain .   In , notice that we have chosen a representative of the least possible weight for each coset. These representatives are coset leaders. Now suppose that is the received word. To decode , we find that it is in the coset ; hence, the originally transmitted codeword must have been .   A potential problem with this method of decoding is that we might have to examine every coset for the received codeword. The following proposition gives a method of implementing coset decoding. It states that we can associate a syndrome with each coset; hence, we can make a table that designates a coset leader corresponding to each syndrome. Such a list is called a Decoding table decoding table .   Syndromes for each coset    Syndrome  Coset Leader                                       Let be an -linear code given by the matrix and suppose that and are in . Then and are in the same coset of if and only if . That is, two -tuples are in the same coset if and only if their syndromes are the same.    Two -tuples and are in the same coset of exactly when ; however, this is equivalent to or .      is a decoding table for the code given in . If is received, then its syndrome can be computed to be . Examining the decoding table, we determine that the coset leader is . It is now easy to decode the received codeword.   Given an -block code, the question arises of whether or not coset decoding is a manageable scheme. A decoding table requires a list of cosets and syndromes, one for each of the cosets of . Suppose that we have a -block code. We have a huge number of codewords, , yet there are only cosets.   "

  "body": " Sage   Sage has a full suite of linear codes and a variety of methods that may be used to investigate them.    Constructing Linear Codes  The codes object can be used to get a concise listing of the available implemented codes. Type codes. and press the Tab key and most interfaces to Sage will give you a list. You can then use a question mark at the end of a method name to learn about the various parameters.   We will use the classic binary Hamming code as an illustration. Binary means we have vectors with just 0's and 1's, the is the length and means the vectors have coordinates, and the is the dimension, meaning this code has vectors comprising the code. The documentation assumes we know a few things from later in the course. We use GF(2) to specify that our code is binary this will make more sense at the end of the course. A second parameter is r and we can see from the formulas in the documenation that setting r=3 will give length .     Properties of Linear Codes  We can examine the Hamming code we just built. First the dimension.   The code is small enough that we can list all the codewords.   The minimum distance is perhaps one of the most important properties. Hamming codes always have minimum distance , so they are always single error-correcting.   We know that the parity-check matrix and the generator matrix are useful for the construction, description and analysis of linear codes. The Sage method names are just a bit cryptic. Sage has extensive routines for analyzing matrices with elements from different fields, so we perform much of the subsequent analysis of these matrices within Sage.   The generator matrix here in the text has columns that are codewords, and linear combinations of the columns (the column space of the matrix) are codewords. In Sage the generator matrix has rows that are codewords and the row space of the matrix is the code. So here is another place where we need to mentally translate between a choice made in the text and a choice made by the Sage developers.   Here is a partial test that these two matrices are correct, exercising . Notice that we need to use the transpose of the generator matrix, for reasons described above.   Note that the parity-check may not be canonical and the generator matrix may not be standard. Sage can produce a generator matrix that has a set of columns that forms an identity matrix, though no guarantee is made that these columns are the first columns. (Columns, not rows.) Such a matrix is said to be systematic , and the Sage method is .systematic_generator_matrix() .     Decoding with a Linear Code  We can decode received messages originating from a linear code. Suppose we receive the length binary vector r .   We can recognize that one or more errors has occured, since r is not in the code, as the next computation does not yield the zero vector.   A linear code has a .decode method. You may choose from several different algorithms, while the Hamming codes have their own custom algorithm. The default algorithm is syndrome decoding.   So if we are willing to assume that only one error occured (which we might, if the probability of an indivual entry of the vector being in error is very low), then we see that an error occured in the third position.  Remember that it could happen that there was more than just one error. For example, suppose the message was the same as before and errors occurred in the third, fifth and sixth locations.   It then appears that we have received a codeword, so we assume no errors at all, and decode incorrectly.     "

Read the documentation to be sure you build the binary version (not ternary), and do not build the extended version (which is the default).    Use Sage methods to compute the length, dimension and minimum distance of the code.    How many errors can this code detect? How many can it correct?    Find a nonzero codeword and introduce three errors by adding a vector with three 1's (your choice) to create a received message. Show that the message is decoded properly.    Recycle your choices from the previous part, but now add one more error. Does the new received message get decoded properly?      One technique for improving the characteristics of a code is to add an overall parity-check bit, much like the lone parity-check bit of the ASCII code described in . Such codes are referred to as the extended version of the original.    Construct the (binary) Golay code and obtain the parity-check matrix. Use Sage commands to enlarge this matrix to create a new parity check matrix that has an additional overall parity-check bit. You may find the matrix methods .augment() and .stack() useful, as well as the constructors zero_vector() and ones_matrix() (remembering that we specify the binary entries as being from the field GF(2) .)  Create the extended code by supplying your enlarged parity-check matrix to the codes.from_parity_check_matrix() constructor and compute the length, dimension and minimum distance of the extended code.    How are the properties of this new code better? At what cost?    Now create the extended (binary) Golay code with the Sage constructor codes.GolayCode() and the correct keyword to obtain the extended version. With luck, the sorted lists of your codewords and Sage's codewords will be equal. If not, the linear code method .is_permutation_equivalent() should return True to indicate that your code and Sage's are just rearrangements of each other.       Note: This problem is on holiday (as of Sage 6.7), while some buggy Sage code for the minimum distance of a Hamming code gets sorted out. The r = 2 case produces an error message and for r > 5 the computation of the minimum distance has become intolerably slow. So it is a bit harder to make a reasonable conjecture from just cases.  The dual of an block code is formed as all the set of all binary vectors which are orthogonal to every vector of the original code. describes this construction and asks about some of its properties.  You can construct the dual of a code in Sage with the .dual_code() method. Construct the binary Hamming codes, and their duals, with the parameter r ranging from 2 to 5 , inclusive. Build a table with six columns (perhaps employing the html.table() function) that lists , the length of the codes, the dimensions of the original and the dual, and the minimum distances of the orginal and the dual.  Conjecture formulas for the dimension and minimum distance of the dual of the Hamming code as expressions in the parameter .    A code with minimum distance is called perfect if every possible vector is within Hamming distance of some codeword. If we expand our notion of geometry to account for the Hamming distance as the metric, then we can speak of a sphere of radius around a vector (or codeword. For a code of length , such a sphere will contain vectors within in it. For a perfect code, the spheres of radius centered at the codewords of the code will exactly partition the entire set of all possible vectors. (This is the connection that means that coding theory meshes with sphere packing problems.)  A consequence of a code of dimension being perfect is that Conversely, if a code has minimum distance and the condition above is true, then the code is perfect.  Write a Python function, named is_perfect() which accepts a linear code as input and returns True or False . Demonstrate your function by checking that the (binary) Golay code is perfect, and then use a loop to verify that the (binary) Hamming codes are perfect for all lengths below .    "

The main goal in group theory is to classify all groups; however, it makes sense to consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic. We state this result in the following theorem, whose proof is left as an exercise.    The isomorphism of groups determines an equivalence relation on the class of all groups.    Hence, we can modify our goal of classifying all groups to classifying all groups up to isomorphism ; that is, we will consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic.    Cayley's Theorem  Cayley proved that if is a group, it is isomorphic to a group of permutations on some set; hence, every group is a permutation group. Cayley's Theorem is what we call a representation theorem. The aim of representation theory is to find an isomorphism of some group that we wish to study into a group that we know a great deal about, such as a group of permutations or matrices.   Consider the group . The Cayley table for is as follows.     The addition table of suggests that it is the same as the permutation group . The isomorphism here is .

Historical Note  Arthur Cayley Cayley, Arthur was born in England in 1821, though he spent much of the first part of his life in Russia, where his father was a merchant. Cayley was educated at Cambridge, where he took the first Smith's Prize in mathematics. A lawyer for much of his adult life, he wrote several papers in his early twenties before entering the legal profession at the age of 25. While practicing law he continued his mathematical research, writing more than 300 papers during this period of his life. These included some of his best work. In 1863 he left law to become a professor at Cambridge. Cayley wrote more than 900 papers in fields such as group theory, geometry, and linear algebra. His legal knowledge was very valuable to Cambridge; he participated in the writing of many of the university's statutes. Cayley was also one of the people responsible for the admission of women to Cambridge.   "

If , we often write instead of .   The group , considered as a set, is just the set of all binary -tuples. The group operation is the exclusive or of two binary -tuples. For example, . This group is important in coding theory, in cryptography, and in many areas of computer science.     Let .

Internal Direct Products  The external direct product of two groups builds a large group out of two smaller groups. We would like to be able to reverse this process and conveniently break down a group into its direct product components; that is, we would like to be able to say when a group is isomorphic to the direct product of two of its subgroups.

The dihedral group is an internal direct product of its two subgroups . It can easily be shown that ; consequently, .    Not every group can be written as the internal direct product of two of its proper subgroups. If the group were an internal direct product of its proper subgroups and , then one of the subgroups, say , would have to have order . In this case is the subgroup . The subgroup must have order , but no matter which subgroup we choose for , the condition that will never be satisfied for and .     Let be the internal direct product of subgroups and .

  "body": " Sage   Sage has limited support for actually creating isomorphisms, though it is possible. However, there is excellent support for determining if two permutation groups are isomorphic. This will allow us to begin a little project to locate all of the groups of order less than in Sage's permutation groups.    Isomorphism Testing  If G and H are two permutation groups, then the command G.is_isomorphic(H) will return True or False as the two groups are, or are not, isomorphic. Since isomorpic to is an equivalence relation by , it does not matter which group plays the role of G and which plays the role of H .  So we have a few more examples to work with, let us introduce the Sage command that creates an external direct product. If G and H are two permutation groups, then the command direct_product_permgroups([G,H]) will return the external direct product as a new permutation group. Notice that this is a function (not a method) and the input is a list. Rather than just combining two groups in the list, any number of groups can be supplied. We illustrate isomorphism testing and direct products in the context of , which is an equivalence, so tells us exactly when we have isomorphic groups. We use cyclic permutation groups as stand-ins for by .  First, two isomorphic groups.    Now, two non-isomorphic groups.    Notice how the simple computation of a greatest common divisor predicts the incredibly complicated computation of determining if two groups are isomorphic. This is a nice illustration of the power of mathematics, replacing a difficult problem (group isomorphism) by a simple one (factoring and divisibility of integers). Let us build one more direct product of cyclic groups, but with three groups, each with orders that are pairwise relatively prime.  If you try the following with larger parameters you may get an error ( database_gap ).     Classifying Finite Groups  Once we understand isomorphic groups as being the same , or fundamentally no different, or structurally identical, then it is natural to ask how many really different finite groups there are. gives a partial answer: for each prime there is just one finite group, with as a concrete manifestation.  Let us embark on a quest to find all the groups of order less than in Sage as permutation groups. For prime orders and we know there is really just one group each, and we can realize them all:   So now our smallest unknown case is order . Sage knows at least three such groups, and we can use Sage to check if any pair is isomorphic. Notice that since isomorphic to is an equivalence relation, and hence a transitive relation, the two tests below are sufficient.    So we have at least two different groups: and , with the latter also known as the Klein 4-group. Sage will not be able to tell us if we have a complete list this will always require theoretical results like . We will shortly have a more general result that handles the case of order , but right now, a careful analysis (by hand) of the possibilities for the Cayley table of a group of order should lead you to the two possibilities above as the only possibilities. Try to deduce what the Cayley table of an order group should look like, since you know about identity elements, inverses and cancellation.  We have seen at least two groups of order (next on our list of non-prime orders). One is abelian and one is not, so we do not need Sage to tell us they are structurally different. But let us do it anyway.   Is that all? There is , but that is just since and are relatively prime. The dihedral group, , all symmetries of a triangle, is just , the symmetric group on symbols.    from this section classifies all groups of order , where is a prime. Such a group is either cyclic or a dihedral group. So the two groups above, and , are the complete list of groups of order .  By this general result, in addition to order , we also know the complete lists of groups of orders and . To Be Continued.    Internal Direct Products  An internal direct product is a statement about subgroups of a single group, together with a theorem that links them to an external direct product. We will work an example here that will illustrate the nature of an internal direct product.  Given an integer , the set of positive integers less than , and relatively prime to forms a group under multiplication mod . We will work in the set Integers(n) where we can add and multiply, but we want to stay strictly with multiplication only.  First we build the subgroup itself. Notice how we must convert x into an integer (an element of ZZ ) so that the greatest common divisor computation performs correctly.   So we have a group of order . We are going to try to find a subgroup of order and a subgroup of order to form the internal direct product, and we will restrict our search initially to cyclic subgroups of order . Sage has a method that will give the order of each of these elements, relative to multiplication, so let us examine those next.   We have many choices for generators of a cyclic subgroup of order and for a cyclic subgroup of order . Of course, some of the choices for a generator of the subgroup of order will generate the same subgroup. Can you tell, just by counting, how many subgroups of order there are? We are going to pick the first element of order , and the last element of order , for no particular reason. After your work through this once, we encourage you to try other choices to understand why some choices lead to an internal direct product and some do not. Notice that we choose the elements from the list U so that they are sure to be elements of Z36 and behave properly when multiplied.    So A and B are two cyclic subgroups. Notice that their intersection is the identity element, one of our requirements for an internal direct product. So this is a good start.    Z36 is an abelian group, thus the condition on all products commuting will hold, but we illustrate the Sage commands that will check this in a non-abelian situation.   Finally, we need to check that by forming products with elements from A and B we create the entire group. Sorting the resulting list will make a check easier for us visually, and is required if we want Sage to do the check.    That's it. We now condense all this information into the statement that U is the internal direct product of A and B . By , we see that U is isomorphic to a product of a cyclic group of order and a cyclic group of order . So in a very real sense, U is no more or less complicated than , which is in turn isomorphic to . So we totally understand the structure of U . For example, we can see that U is not cyclic, since when written as a product of cyclic groups, the two orders are not relatively prime. The final expression of U suggests you could find three cyclic subgroups of U , with orders , and , so that U is an internal direct product of the three subgroups.   "

Of course, we already have a whole class of examples of simple groups, , where is prime. These groups are trivially simple since they have no proper subgroups other than the subgroup consisting solely of the identity. Other examples of simple groups are not so easily found. We can, however, show that the alternating group, , is simple for . The proof of this result requires several lemmas.    The alternating group is generated by -cycles for .

Historical Note  One of the foremost problems of group theory has been to classify all Group simple simple finite groups. This problem is over a century old and has been solved only in the last few decades of the twentieth century. In a sense, finite simple groups are the building blocks of all finite groups. The first nonabelian simple groups to be discovered were the alternating groups. Galois was the first to prove that was simple. Later, mathematicians such as C. Jordan Jordan, C. and L. E. Dickson Dickson, L. E. found several infinite families of matrix groups that were simple. Other families of simple groups were discovered in the 1950s. At the turn of the century, William Burnside Burnside, William conjectured that all nonabelian simple groups must have even order. In 1963, W. Feit Feit, W. and J. Thompson Thompson, J. proved Burnside's conjecture and published their results in the paper Solvability of Groups of Odd Order, which appeared in the Pacific Journal of Mathematics . Their proof, running over 250 pages, gave impetus to a program in the 1960s and 1970s to classify all finite simple groups. Daniel Gorenstein Gorenstein, Daniel was the organizer of this remarkable effort. One of the last simple groups was the Monster, discovered by Greiss, R. R. Greiss. The Monster, a matrix group, is one of the 26 sporadic, or special, simple groups. These sporadic simple groups are groups that fit into no infinite family of simple groups. Some of the sporadic groups play an important role in physics.   "

  "title": "Sage",
  "body": " Sage   Sage has several convenient functions that will allow us to investigate quickly if a subgroup is normal, and if so, the nature of the resulting quotient group. But for an initial understanding, we can also work with the raw cosets. Let us get our hands dirty first, then learn about the easy way.    Multiplying Cosets  The definiton of a factor group requires a normal subgroup, and then we define a way to multiply two cosets of the subgroup to produce another coset. It is important to realize that we can interpret the definition of a normal subgroup to be exactly the condition we need for our new multiplication to be workable. We will do two examples first with a normal subgroup, then with a subgroup that is not normal.  Consider the dihedral group that is the symmetry group of an -gon. If we take the element that creates a quarter-turn, we can use it generate a cyclic subgroup of order 4. This will be a normal subgroup (trust us for the moment on this). First, build the (right) cosets (notice there is no output):   So C is a list of lists, with every element of the group G occuring exactly once somewhere. You could ask Sage to print out C for you if you like, but we will try to avoid that here. We want to multiply two cosets (lists) together. How do we do this? Take any element out of the first list, and any element out of the second list and multiply them together (which we know how to do since they are elements of G ). Now we have an element of G . What do we do with this element, since we really want a coset as the result of the product of two cosets? Simple we see which coset the product is in. Let us give it a try. We will multiply coset with coset (there are cosets by Lagrange's Theorem). Study the following code carefully to see if you can understand what it is doing, and then read the explanation that follows.   What have we accomplished? In the first line we create p as the product of two group elements, one from coset and one from coset ( C[1] , C[3] ). Since we can choose any element from each coset, we choose the first element of each ( C[ ][0] ). Then we count our way through all the cosets, selecting only cosets that contain p . Since p will only be in one coset, we expect a list with just one element. Here, our one-element list contains only 2 . So we say the product of coset and coset is coset .  The point here is that this result (coset times coset is coset ) should always be the same, no matter which elements we pick from the two cosets to form  p . So let us do it again, but this time we will not simply choose the first element from each of coset and coset , instead we will choose the third element of coset and the second element of coset (remember, we are counting from zero!).   Good. We have the same result. If you are still trusting us on S being a normal subgroup of G , then this is the result that the theory predicts. Make a copy of the above compute cell and try other choices for the representatives of each coset. Then try the product of other cosets, with varying representatives.   Now is a good time to introduce a way to extend Sage and add new functions. We will design a coset-multiplication function. Read the following carefully and then see the subsequent explanation.   The first line creates a new Sage function named coset_product . This is accomplished with the word def , and note the colon ending the line. The inputs to the function are the numbers of the cosets we want to multiply and the complete list of the cosets. The middle two lines should look familiar from above. We know c is a one-element list, so c[0] will extract this one coset number, and return is what determines that this is the output of the function. Notice that the indentation above must be exactly as shown. We could have written all this computation on a single line without making a new function, but that begins to get unwieldly. You need to execute the code block above to actually define the function, and there will be no output if successful. Now we can use our new function to repeat our work above:   Now you know the basics of how to add onto Sage and do much more than it was designed for. And with some practice, you could suggest and contribute new functions to Sage, since it is an open source project. Nice.  Now let us examine a situation where the subgroup is not normal. So we will see that our definition of coset multiplication is insufficient in this case. And realize that our new coset_product function is also useless since it assumes the cosets come from a normal subgroup.  Consider the alternating group which we can interpet as the symmetry group of a tetrahedron. For a subgroup, take an element that fixes one vertex and rotates the opposite face this will generate a cyclic subgroup of order 3, and by Lagrange's Theorem we will get four cosets. We compute them here. (Again, no output is requested.)   Again, let's consider the product of coset and coset :   Again, but now for coset , choose the second element of the coset to produce the product p :   So, is the product of coset and coset equal to coset or coset ? We cannot say! So there is no way to construct a quotient group for this subgroup. You can experiment some more with this subgroup, but in some sense, we are done with this example there is nothing left to say.    Sage Methods for Normal Subgroups  You can easily ask Sage if a subgroup is normal or not. This is viewed as a property of the subgroup, but you must tell Sage what the supergroup is, since the answer can change depending on this value. (For example H.is_normal(H) will always be True .) Here are our two examples from above.    The text proves in that is simple,  has no normal subgroups. We could build every subgroup of and ask if it is normal in using the .is_normal() method. But Sage has this covered for us already.   We can also build a quotient group when we have a normal subgroup.   This is useful, but also a bit unsettling. We have the quotient group, but any notion of cosets has been lost, since Q is returned as a new permutation group on a different set of symbols. We cannot presume that the numbers used for the new permutation group Q bear any resemblance to the cosets we get from the .cosets() method. But we can see that the quotient group is described as a group generated by two elements of order two. We could ask for the order of the group, or by Lagrange's Theorem we know the quotient has order . We can say now that there are only two groups of order four, the cyclic group of order and a non-cyclic group of order , known to us as the Klein -group or . This quotient group looks like the non-cyclic one since the cyclic group of order 4 has just one element of order 2. Let us see what Sage says.   Yes, that's it.  Finally, Sage can build us a list of all of the normal subgroups of a group. The list of groups themselves, as we have seen before, is sometimes an overwhelming amount of information. We will demonstrate by just listing the orders of the normal subgroups produced.   So, in particular, we see that our quarter-turn subgroup is the only normal subgroup of order in this group.   "

  "body": " Sage   Sage is able to create homomorphisms (and by extension, isomorphisms and automorphisms) between finite permutation groups. There is a limited supply of commands then available to manipulate these functions, but we can still illustrate many of the ideas in this chapter.    Homomorphisms  The principal device for creating a homomorphism is to specify the specific images of the set of generators for the domain. Consider cyclic groups of order and : and define a homomorphism by just defining the image of the generator of , and define the rest of the mapping by extending the mapping via the operation-preserving property of a homomorphism. The constructor PermutationGroupMorphism requires the two groups, then a list of images for each generator (in order!), and then will create the homomorphism. Note that we can then use the result as a function. In the example below, we first verify that C12 has a single generator (no surprise there), which we then send to a particular element of order in the codomain. Sage then constructs the unique homomorphism that is consistent with this requirement.        Note that the element c must therefore be in the kernel of phi .  We can then compute the subgroup of the domain that is the kernel, in this case a cyclic group of order inside the cyclic group of order . We can compute the image of any subgroup, but here we will build the whole homomorphic image by supplying the whole domain to the .image() method. Here the image is a cyclic subgroup of order inside the cyclic group of order . Then we can verify the First Isomorphism Theorem.     Here is a slightly more complicated example. The dihedral group is the symmetry group of a -gon. Inside this group is a subgroup that is isomorphic to the symmetry group of a -gon (pentagon). Is this a surprise, or is this obvious? Here is a way to make precise the statement contains a copy of .   We build the domain and find its generators, so we know how many images to supply in the definition of the homomorphism. Then we construct the codomain, from which we will construct images. Our choice here is to send a reflection to a reflection, and a rotation to a rotation. But the rotations will both have order , and both are a rotation by degrees.     Since the kernel is trivial, rho is a one-to-one function (see ). But more importantly, by the First Isomorphishm Theorem, G is isomorphic to the image of the homomorphism. We compute the image and check the claim.     Just providing a list of images for the generators of the domain is no guarantee that the function will extend to a homomorphism. For starters, the order of each image must divide the order of the corresponding preimage. (Can you prove this?) And similarly, if the domain is abelian, then the image must also be abelian, so in this case the list of images should not generate a non-abelian subgroup. Here is an example. There are no homomorphisms from a cyclic group of order to a cyclic group of order (other than the trivial function that takes every element to the identity). To see this, consider the possible orders of the kernel, and of the two possibilities, see that one is impossible and the other arises with the trivial homomorphism. Unfortunately, Sage acts as if nothing is wrong in creating a homomorphism between these groups, but what Sage builds is useless and raises errors when you try to use it.    Rather than creating homomorphisms ourselves, in certain situations Sage knows of the existence of natural homomorphisms and will create them for you. One such case is a direct product construction. Given a group G , the method .direct_product(H) will create the direct product . (This is not the same command as the function direct_product_permgroups() from before.) Not only does this command create the direct product, but it also builds four homomorphisms, one with domain , one with domain and two with domain . So the output consists of five objects, the first being the actual group, and the remainder are homomorphisms. We will demonstrate the call here, and leave a more thorough investigation for the exercises.        "

One of the most fundamental ideas of linear algebra is that of a linear transformation. A linear transformation Linear transformation definition of or linear map Linear map  is a map that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, for vectors and in and a scalar , . An matrix with entries in represents a linear transformation from to . If we write vectors and in as column matrices, then an matrix maps the vectors to linearly by matrix multiplication. Observe that if is a real number, , where . We will often abbreviate the matrix by writing .   matrix    Conversely, if is a linear map, we can associate a matrix with by considering what does to the vectors . We can write any vector as . Consequently, if , then .   If we let be the map given by , the axioms that must satisfy to be a linear transformation are easily verified. The column vectors and tell us that is given by the matrix .   Since we are interested in groups of matrices, we need to know which matrices have multiplicative inverses. Recall that an matrix is invertible Matrix invertible exactly when there exists another matrix such that , where is the identity matrix. From linear algebra we know that is invertible if and only if the determinant of is nonzero. Sometimes an invertible matrix is said to be Matrix nonsingular nonsingular .   If is the matrix , then the inverse of is . We are guaranteed that exists, since is nonzero.   Some other facts about determinants will also prove useful in the course of this chapter. Let and be matrices. From linear algebra we have the following properties of determinants.   The determinant is a homomorphism into the multiplicative group of real numbers; that is, .    If is an invertible matrix, then .    If we define the transpose of a matrix to be , then .    Let be the linear transformation associated with an matrix . Then multiplies volumes by a factor of . In the case of , this means that multiplies areas by .     Linear maps, matrices, and determinants are covered in any elementary linear algebra text; however, if you have not had a course in linear algebra, it is a straightforward process to verify these properties directly for matrices, the case with which we are most concerned.    The General and Special Linear Groups  The set of all invertible matrices forms a group called the Group general linear general linear group . We will denote this group by . The general linear group has several important subgroups. The multiplicative properties of the determinant imply that the set of matrices with determinant one is a subgroup of the general linear group. Stated another way, suppose that and . Then and . This subgroup is called the special linear group Group special linear and is denoted by .   Given a matrix , the determinant of is . The group consists of those matrices in which .

The orthogonal group Group orthogonal Orthogonal group consists of the set of all orthogonal matrices.

There is a more geometric way of viewing the group . The orthogonal matrices are exactly those matrices that preserve the length of vectors. We can define the length of a vector using the Euclidean inner product , Euclidean inner product or dot product , of two vectors. The Euclidean inner product of two vectors and is . We define the length of a vector to be   length of a vector   . Associated with the notion of the length of a vector is the idea of the distance between two vectors. We define the distance between two vectors and to be . We leave as an exercise the proof of the following proposition about the properties of Euclidean inner products.

Consider the column vectors of the orthogonal matrix . Since , , where is the Kronecker delta Kronecker delta. Accordingly, column vectors of an orthogonal matrix all have length 1; and the Euclidean inner product of distinct column vectors is zero. Any set of vectors satisfying these properties is called an Orthonormal set orthonormal set . Conversely, given an matrix whose columns form an orthonormal set, it follows that .  We say that a matrix is distance-preserving , Matrix distance-preserving  length-preserving , Matrix length-preserving or inner product-preserving Matrix inner product-preserving when , , or , respectively. The following theorem, which characterizes the orthogonal group, says that these notions are the same.    Let be an matrix. The following statements are equivalent.

It is not difficult to show that must be a one-to-one map. By , any element in is an isometry on ; however, does not include all possible isometries on . Translation by a vector , is also an isometry ( ); however, cannot be in since it is not a linear map.  We are mostly interested in isometries in . In fact, the only isometries in are rotations and reflections about the origin, translations, and combinations of the two. For example, a glide reflection Glide reflection is a translation followed by a reflection ( ). In all isometries are given in the same manner. The proof is very easy to generalize.    Glide reflections    A set of axes with an arrow pointing up and right from the origin to a point x.     A set of axes with an arrow of the same length but pointing down and right from a point on the horizontal axis to a point T(x).        An isometry that fixes the origin in is a linear transformation. In particular, is given by an element in .    Let be an isometry in fixing the origin. We will first show that preserves inner products. Since , ; therefore, . Consequently, . Now let and be and , respectively. If , then . The linearity of easily follows.    For any arbitrary isometry, , will fix the origin for some vector in ; hence, for some matrix . Consequently, . Given the isometries , their composition is . This last computation allows us to identify the group of isometries on with .    The group of isometries on is the Euclidean group, .    A symmetry group Group symmetry in is a subgroup of the group of isometries on that fixes a set of points . It is important to realize that the symmetry group of depends both on and on . For example, the symmetry group of the origin in is , but the symmetry group of the origin in is .    The only finite symmetry groups in are and .    We simply need to find all of the finite subgroups of . Any finite symmetry group in must fix the origin and must be a finite subgroup of , since translations and glide reflections have infinite order. By , elements in are either rotations of the form or reflections of the form . Notice that , , and . We can divide the proof up into two cases. In the first case, all of the elements in have determinant one. In the second case, there exists at least one element in with determinant .   Case 1  The determinant of every element in is one. In this case every element in must be a rotation. Since is finite, there is a smallest angle, say , such that the corresponding element is the smallest rotation in the positive direction. We claim that generates . If not, then for some positive integer there is an angle between and . If so, then corresponds to a rotation smaller than , which contradicts the minimality of .    Case 2  The group contains a reflection . The kernel of the homomorphism given by consists of elements whose determinant is 1. Therefore, . We know that the kernel is cyclic by the first case and is a subgroup of of, say, order . Hence, . The elements of are . These elements satisfy the relation . Consequently, must be isomorphic to in this case.       The Wallpaper Groups  Suppose that we wish to study wallpaper patterns in the plane or crystals in three dimensions. Wallpaper patterns are simply repeating patterns in the plane ( ). The analogs of wallpaper patterns in are crystals, which we can think of as repeating patterns of molecules in three dimensions ( ). The mathematical equivalent of a wallpaper or crystal pattern is called a lattice.   A wallpaper pattern in    A wallpaper of chevrons with the top row of chevrons pointing downward, the second row of chevrons pointing upwards, and so on.      A crystal structure in    A three-dimensional lattice of cubes that are slanted to the right. The vertices are highlighted with small filled circles.     Let us examine wallpaper patterns in the plane a little more closely. Suppose that and are linearly independent vectors in ; that is, one vector cannot be a scalar multiple of the other. A lattice Lattice of points of and is the set of all linear combinations , where and are integers. The vectors and are said to be a basis Basis of a lattice for the lattice.  Notice that a lattice can have several bases. For example, the vectors and have the same lattice as the vectors and ( ). However, any lattice is completely determined by a basis. Given two bases for the same lattice, say and , we can write , where , , , and are integers. The matrix corresponding to this transformation is . If we wish to give and in terms of and , we need only calculate ; that is, . Since has integer entries, must also have integer entries; hence the determinants of both and must be integers. Because , consequently, . A matrix with determinant and integer entries is called Matrix unimodular unimodular . For example, the matrix is unimodular. It should be clear that there is a minimum length for vectors in a lattice.   A lattice in    A lattice of parallelograms slanted to the right. There are four arrows, each beginning in the center at the origin and pointing to the right to (2,0), pointing up and right to (1,1), pointing up and left to ( minus one, one), and pointing down and left to (minus one, minus one).     We can classify lattices by studying their symmetry groups. The symmetry group of a lattice is the subgroup of that maps the lattice to itself. We consider two lattices in to be equivalent if they have the same symmetry group. Similarly, classification of crystals in is accomplished by associating a symmetry group, called a space group , Group space with each type of crystal. Two lattices are considered different if their space groups are not the same. The natural question that now arises is how many space groups exist.  A space group is composed of two parts: a translation subgroup Subgroup translation and a Group point point . The translation subgroup is an infinite abelian subgroup of the space group made up of the translational symmetries of the crystal; the point group is a finite group consisting of rotations and reflections of the crystal about a point. More specifically, a space group is a subgroup of whose translations are a set of the form , where is a lattice. Space groups are, of course, infinite. Using geometric arguments, we can prove the following theorem (see [5] or [6]).    Every translation group in is isomorphic to .    The point group of is . In particular, must be a subgroup of . Suppose that is a vector in a lattice with space group , translation group , and point group . For any element in , hence, is in the translation group of . More specifically, must be in the lattice . It is important to note that is not usually a subgroup of the space group ; however, if is the translation subgroup of , then . The proof of the following theorem can be found in [2], [5], or [6].    The point group in the wallpaper groups is isomorphic to or , where .    To answer the question of how the point groups and the translation groups can be combined, we must look at the different types of lattices. Lattices can be classified by the structure of a single lattice cell. The possible cell shapes are parallelogram, rectangular, square, rhombic, and hexagonal ( ). The wallpaper groups can now be classified according to the types of reflections that occur in each group: these are ordinarily reflections, glide reflections, both, or none.   Types of lattices in   There are two rows of figures. The left top figure is a lattice of squares, the middle top figure is a lattice of rectangles that are not squares, the right top figure is a lattice of rhombuses slanted to the left. The bottom left figure is a lattice of parallelograms that are not rhombuses slanted to the left. The bottom right figure is a lattice of equilateral triangles, six of which make up a regular hexagon.

A parallelogram on set of axes with the left edge a vector from the origin to (1,1) and bottom edge a vector from the origin to (1,0).      The 17 wallpaper groups are listed in . The groups p3m1 and p31m can be distinguished by whether or not all of their threefold centers lie on the reflection axes: those of p3m1 must, whereas those of p31m may not. Similarly, the fourfold centers of p4m must lie on the reflection axes whereas those of p4g need not ( ). The complete proof of this theorem can be found in several of the references at the end of this chapter, including [5], [6], [10], and [11].    Historical Note  Symmetry groups have intrigued mathematicians for a long time. Leonardo da Vinci was probably the first person to know all of the point groups. At the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert Hilbert, David gave a now-famous address outlining 23 problems to guide mathematics in the twentieth century. Hilbert's eighteenth problem asked whether or not crystallographic groups in dimensions were always finite. In 1910, L. Bieberbach Bieberbach, L. proved that crystallographic groups are finite in every dimension. Finding out how many of these groups there are in each dimension is another matter. In there are 230 different space groups; in there are 4783. No one has been able to compute the number of space groups for and beyond. It is interesting to note that the crystallographic groups were found mathematically for before the 230 different types of crystals were actually discovered in nature.   "

  "body": " Finite Abelian Groups  In our investigation of cyclic groups we found that every group of prime order was isomorphic to , where was a prime number. We also determined that when . In fact, much more is true. Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order; that is, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the type , where each is prime (not necessarily distinct).  First, let us examine a slight generalization of finite abelian groups. Suppose that is a group and let be a set of elements in , where is in some index set (not necessarily finite). The smallest subgroup of containing all of the 's is the subgroup of  generated by the 's. If this subgroup of is in fact all of , then is generated by the set . In this case the 's are said to be the generators Generators for a group Group generators of of . If there is a finite set that generates , then is Group finitely generated Finitely generated group finitely generated .   Obviously, all finite groups are finitely generated. For example, the group is generated by the permutations and . The group is an infinite group but is finitely generated by .    Not all groups are finitely generated. Consider the rational numbers under the operation of addition. Suppose that is finitely generated with generators , where each is a fraction expressed in its lowest terms. Let be some prime that does not divide any of the denominators . We claim that cannot be in the subgroup of that is generated by , since does not divide the denominator of any element in this subgroup. This fact is easy to see since the sum of any two generators is .     Let be the subgroup of a group that is generated by . Then exactly when it is a product of the form , where the s are not necessarily distinct.    Let be the set of all products of the form , where the s are not necessarily distinct. Certainly is a subset of . We need only show that is a subgroup of . If this is the case, then , since is the smallest subgroup containing all the s.  Clearly, the set is closed under the group operation. Since , the identity is in . It remains to show that the inverse of an element in must also be in . However, .    The reason that powers of a fixed may occur several times in the product is that we may have a nonabelian group. However, if the group is abelian, then the s need occur only once. For example, a product such as in an abelian group could always be simplified (in this case, to ).     Now let us restrict our attention to finite abelian groups. We can express any finite abelian group as a finite direct product of cyclic groups. More specifically, letting be prime, we define a group to be a -group Group -group if every element in has as its order a power of . For example, both and are -groups, whereas is a -group. We shall prove the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups which tells us that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic -groups.   Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups   Fundamental Theorem  of Finite Abelian Groups    Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form here the 's are primes (not necessarily distinct).     Suppose that we wish to classify all abelian groups of order . The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups tells us that we have the following six possibilities.    ;     ;     ;     ;     ;     .      The proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups depends on several lemmas.    Let be a finite abelian group of order . If is a prime that divides , then contains an element of order .    We will prove this lemma by induction. If , then there is nothing to show. Now suppose that the lemma is true for all groups of order , where . Furthermore, let be a prime that divides .  If has no proper nontrivial subgroups, then , where is any element other than the identity. By , the order of must be prime. Since divides , we know that , and contains elements of order .  Now suppose that contains a nontrivial proper subgroup . Then . If , then contains an element of order by induction and the lemma is true. Suppose that does not divide the order of . Since is abelian, it must be the case that is a normal subgroup of , and . Consequently, must divide . Since , we know that contains an element of order by the induction hypothesis. Thus, , and but . If , then and are relatively prime, and there exist integers and such that . Furthermore, the order of must divide , and .  We claim that has order . We must show that . Suppose . Then . Since , it must be the case that , which is a contradiction. Therefore, is an element of order in .     is a special case of Cauchy's Theorem ( ), which states that if is a finite group and a prime such that divides the order of , then contains a subgroup of order . We will prove Cauchy's Theorem in .    A finite abelian group is a -group if and only if its order is a power of .    If then by Lagrange’s theorem, then the order of any must divide , and therefore must be a power of . Conversely, if is not a power of , then it has some other prime divisor , so by , has an element of order and thus is not a -group.      Let be a finite abelian group of order , where where are distinct primes and are positive integers. Then is the internal direct product of subgroups , where is the subgroup of consisting of all elements of order for some integer .    Since is an abelian group, we are guaranteed that is a subgroup of for . Since the identity has order , we know that . If has order , then must also have order . Finally, if has order , then , where is the maximum of and .  We must show that and for . Suppose that is in the subgroup generated by . Then for . Since has order , we know that for , and . Since the order of is a power of and , it must be the case that and the intersection of with any of the subgroups is the identity. A similar argument shows that for .  Next, we must show that it possible to write every as a product , where . Since the order of divides the order of , we know that for some integers . Letting , the 's are relatively prime; hence, there exist integers such that . Consequently, . Since , it follows that must be in . Let . Then . Therefore, is an internal direct product of subgroups.        If remains for us to determine the possible structure of each -group in .    Let be a finite abelian -group and suppose that has maximal order. Then is isomorphic to for some subgroup of .    By , we may assume that the order of is . We shall induct on . If , then is cyclic of order and must be generated by . Suppose now that the statement of the lemma holds for all integers with and let be of maximal order in , say . Then for all . Now choose in such that , where has the smallest possible order. Certainly such an exists; otherwise, and we are done. Let .  We claim that . It suffices to show that . Since , the order of is smaller than the order of and must be in by the minimality of ; that is, for some number . Hence, , and the order of must be less than or equal to . Therefore, cannot generate . Notice that must occur as a factor of , say , and . Define to be . Then cannot be in ; otherwise, would also have to be in . Also, . We have now formed an element with order such that . Since was chosen to have the smallest order of all of the elements that are not in , .  Now we will show that the order of in the factor group must be the same as the order of in . If , then hence, must be in , which contradicts the fact that the order of is . Therefore, must have maximal order in . By the Correspondence Theorem and our induction hypothesis, for some subgroup of containing . We claim that . If , then and . It follows that implies that .       The proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups follows very quickly from and . By , is a product of -groups. Suppose is a -group and let be an element of maximal order in . If , then we are done; otherwise, for some subgroup contained in by the . Since , we can apply mathematical induction.  We now state the more general theorem for all finitely generated abelian groups. The proof of this theorem can be found in any of the references at the end of this chapter.   The Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups   Every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form , where the 's are primes (not necessarily distinct).

If each subgroup is normal in , then the series is called a Normal series of a group normal series . The length of a subnormal or normal series is the number of proper inclusions.   Any series of subgroups of an abelian group is a normal series. Consider the following series of groups: .    A subnormal series need not be a normal series. Consider the following subnormal series of the group : . The subgroup is not normal in ; consequently, this series is not a normal series.   A subnormal (normal) series is a refinement of a subnormal (normal) series  if . That is, each is one of the .   The series is a refinement of the series .   The best way to study a subnormal or normal series of subgroups, of , is actually to study the factor groups . We say that two subnormal (normal) series and of a group are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the collections of factor groups and .   The two normal series of the group are isomorphic since .   A subnormal series of a group is a composition series Composition series if all the factor groups are simple; that is, if none of the factor groups of the series contains a normal subgroup. A normal series of is a principal series Principal series if all the factor groups are simple.   The group has a composition series with factor groups . Since is an abelian group, this series is automatically a principal series. Notice that a composition series need not be unique. The series is also a composition series.    For , the series is a composition series for since and is simple.      Not every group has a composition series or a principal series. Suppose that is a subnormal series for the integers under addition. Then must be of the form for some . In this case is an infinite cyclic group with many nontrivial proper normal subgroups.     Although composition series need not be unique as in the case of , it turns out that any two composition series are related. The factor groups of the two composition series for are , , , and ; that is, the two composition series are isomorphic. The Jordan-Hölder Theorem says that this is always the case.   Jordan-Hölder   Jordan-Hölder Theorem    Any two composition series of are isomorphic.    We shall employ mathematical induction on the length of the composition series. If the length of a composition series is 1, then must be a simple group. In this case any two composition series are isomorphic.  Suppose now that the theorem is true for all groups having a composition series of length , where . Let be two composition series for . We can form two new subnormal series for since is normal in and is normal in : . Since is normal in , the Second Isomorphism Theorem ( ) implies that , where is normal in . Since is a composition series, must be simple; consequently, is either or . That is, must be either or . Removing any nonproper inclusions from the series , we have a composition series for . Our induction hypothesis says that this series must be equivalent to the composition series . Hence, the composition series and are equivalent. If , then the composition series and are equivalent and we are done; otherwise, is a normal subgroup of properly containing . In this case and we can apply the Second Isomorphism Theorem once again; that is, . Therefore, and are equivalent and the proof of the theorem is complete.    A group is solvable Group solvable if it has a subnormal series such that all of the factor groups are abelian. Solvable groups will play a fundamental role when we study Galois theory and the solution of polynomial equations.     The group is solvable since has abelian factor groups; however, for the series is a composition series for with a nonabelian factor group. Therefore, is not a solvable group for .   "

  "body": " Sage   Cyclic groups, and direct products of cyclic groups, are implemented in Sage as permutation groups. However, these groups quickly become very unwieldly representations and it should be easier to work with finite abelian groups in Sage. So we will postpone any specifics for this chapter until that happens. However, now that we understand the notion of isomorphic groups and the structure of finite abelian groups, we can return to our quest to classify all of the groups with order less than .    Classification of Finite Groups  It does not take any sophisticated tools to understand groups of order , where is an odd prime. There are two possibilities a cyclic group of order and the dihedral group of order that is the set of symmetries of a regular -gon. The proof requires some close, tight reasoning, but the required theorems are generally just concern orders of elements, Lagrange's Theorem and cosets. See . This takes care of orders .  For , the upcoming will tell us that any group of order (where is a prime) is abelian. So we know from this section that the only two possibilities are and . Similarly, the upcoming will tell us that every group of order is abelian. Now this leaves just one possibility for this order: .  We have just two orders left to analyze: and . The possibilities are groups we already know, with one exception. However, the analysis that these are the only possibilities is more complicated, and will not be pursued now, nor in the next few chapters. Notice that is more complicated still, with different possibilities (which explains why we stopped here).  For there are abelian groups, and the two non-abelian groups are the dihedral group (symmetries of a square) and the quaternions.  For there are abelian groups, and non-abelian groups. We know two of the non-abelian groups as a dihedral group, and the alternating group on symbols (which is also the symmetries of a tetrahedron). The third non-abelian group is an example of a dicyclic group, which is an infinite family of groups, each with order divisible by . The order dicyclic group can also be constructed as a semi-direct product of two cyclic groups this is a construction worth knowing as you pursue further study of group theory. The order dicyclic group is also the quaternions and more generally, the dicyclic groups of order , are known as generalized quaternion groups.   The following examples will show you how to construct some of these groups, while also exercising a few of the commands and allowing us to be more certain the following table is accurate.

  "body": " Burnside's Counting Theorem   Suppose that we wish to color the vertices of a square with two different colors, say black and white. We might suspect that there would be different colorings. However, some of these colorings are equivalent. If we color the first vertex black and the remaining vertices white, it is the same as coloring the second vertex black and the remaining ones white since we could obtain the second coloring simply by rotating the square ( ).   Equivalent colorings of square    Four squares with vertices labeled clockwise BWWW, WBWW, WWWB, and WWBW beginning in the upper left corner.     Burnside's Counting Theorem offers a method of computing the number of distinguishable ways in which something can be done. In addition to its geometric applications, the theorem has interesting applications to areas in switching theory and chemistry. The proof of Burnside's Counting Theorem depends on the following lemma.    Let be a -set and suppose that . Then is isomorphic to . In particular, .    Let act on by . Since , there exists a such that . Let . Since , we can define a map by . The map is a homomorphism since . Suppose that . Then or ; hence, the map is injective.

We look at all the fixed points of all the elements in ; that is, we look at all 's and all 's such that . If viewed in terms of fixed point sets, the number of all 's fixing 's is . However, if viewed in terms of the stabilizer subgroups, this number is hence, . By , . By and Lagrange's Theorem, this expression is equal to . Summing over all of the distinct orbits, we conclude that .     Let and suppose that is the permutation group . The orbits of are , , and . The fixed point sets are . Burnside's Theorem says that .     A Geometric Example  Before we apply Burnside's Theorem to switching-theory problems, let us examine the number of ways in which the vertices of a square can be colored black or white. Notice that we can sometimes obtain equivalent colorings by simply applying a rigid motion to the square. For instance, as we have pointed out, if we color one of the vertices black and the remaining three white, it does not matter which vertex was colored black since a rotation will give an equivalent coloring.  The symmetry group of a square, , is given by the following permutations: The group acts on the set of vertices in the usual manner. We can describe the different colorings by mappings from into where and represent the colors black and white, respectively. Each map describes a way to color the corners of the square. Every induces a permutation of the possible colorings given by for . For example, suppose that is defined by and . Then sends vertex to and the remaining vertices to . The set of all such is a permutation group on the set of possible colorings. Let denote the set of all possible colorings; that is, is the set of all possible maps from to . Now we must compute the number of -equivalence classes.    since the identity fixes every possible coloring. .     consists of all such that is unchanged by the permutation . In this case , so that all values of must be the same; that is, either or for every vertex of the square. So .     .    For , and . Thus, .     .     .    For , and the other corners can be of any color; hence, .     .   By Burnside's Theorem, we can conclude that there are exactly ways to color the vertices of the square.    Let be a permutation group of and the set of functions from to . Then induces a group that permutes the elements of , where is defined by for and . Furthermore, if is the number of cycles in the cycle decomposition of , then .    Let and . Since permutes the elements of , must also be in . Suppose that is another function from to such that . Then for each , . Since is a permutation of , every element in is the image of some in under ; hence, and agree on all elements of . Therefore, and is injective. The map is onto, since the two sets are the same size.  Suppose that is a permutation of with cycle decomposition . Any in must have the same value on each cycle of . Since there are cycles and possible values for each cycle, .     Let and suppose that . If is the permutation of given by , then . Any must have the same value on each cycle in . There are such choices for any value, so .     Suppose that we wish to color the vertices of a square using four different colors. By , we can immediately decide that there are possible ways.     Switching Functions  In switching theory we are concerned with the design of electronic circuits with binary inputs and outputs. The simplest of these circuits is a switching function that has inputs and a single output ( ). Large electronic circuits can often be constructed by combining smaller modules of this kind. The inherent problem here is that even for a simple circuit a large number of different switching functions can be constructed. With only four inputs and a single output, we can construct 65,536 different switching functions. However, we can often replace one switching function with another merely by permuting the input leads to the circuit ( ).   A switching function of variables    A function, f, represented by a box with inputs, x1, x2, ..., xn, on the left, and an output f(x1, x2, ..., xn) on the right.     We define a switching Function switching Switching function or Boolean function Boolean function Function Boolean of variables to be a function from to . Since any switching function can have two possible values for each binary -tuple and there are binary -tuples, switching functions are possible for variables. In general, allowing permutations of the inputs greatly reduces the number of different kinds of modules that are needed to build a large circuit.    Switching functions in two variables    The function on the left is represented by a rectangle that has inputs a and b on the left and output f(a, b).     The function on the right is represented by a rectangle that has inputs a and b with leads switched on the left and an output f(b, a) on the right.      The possible switching functions with two input variables and are listed in . Two switching functions and are equivalent if can be obtained from by a permutation of the input variables. For example, . In this case via the permutation . In the case of switching functions of two variables, the permutation reduces 16 possible switching functions to 12 equivalent functions since .   Switching functions in two variables              Inputs  Outputs                                                                Inputs  Outputs                                                                 For three input variables there are possible switching functions; in the case of four variables there are . The number of equivalence classes is too large to reasonably calculate directly. It is necessary to employ Burnside's Theorem.  Consider a switching function with three possible inputs, , , and . As we have mentioned, two switching functions and are equivalent if a permutation of the input variables of gives . It is important to notice that a permutation of the switching functions is not simply a permutation of the input values . A switching function is a set of output values for the inputs , , and , so when we consider equivalent switching functions, we are permuting possible outputs, not just three input values. For example, each binary triple has a specific output associated with it. The permutation changes outputs as follows: .  Let be the set of output values for a switching function in variables. Then . We can enumerate these values as follows: . Now let us consider a circuit with four input variables and a single output. Suppose that we can permute the leads of any circuit according to the following permutation group: . The permutations of the four possible input variables induce the permutations of the output values in .  Hence, there are possible switching functions of four variables under this group of permutations. This number will be even smaller if we consider the full symmetric group on four letters.

He attended Cambridge University from 1871 to 1875 and won the Smith's Prize in his last year. After his graduation he lectured at Cambridge. He was made a member of the Royal Society in 1893. Burnside wrote approximately 150 papers on topics in applied mathematics, differential geometry, and probability, but his most famous contributions were in group theory. Several of Burnside's conjectures have stimulated research to this day. One such conjecture was that every group of odd order is solvable; that is, for a group of odd order, there exists a sequence of subgroups such that is normal in and is abelian. This conjecture was finally proven by W. Feit Feit, W. and J. Thompson Thompson, J. in 1963. Burnside's The Theory of Groups of Finite Order , published in 1897, was one of the first books to treat groups in a modern context as opposed to permutation groups. The second edition, published in 1911, is still a classic.   "

  "body": " Sage   Groups can be realized in many ways, such as as sets of permutations, as sets of matrices, or as sets of abstract symbols related by certain rules ( presentations ) and in myriad other ways. We have concentrated on permutation groups because of their concrete feel, with elements written as functions, and because of their thorough implementation in Sage. Group actions are of great interest when the set they act on is the group itself, and group actions will figure prominently in the proofs of the main results of the next chapter. However, any time we have a group action on a set, we can view that group as a permutation group on the elements of the set. So permutation groups are an area of group theory of independent interest, with its own definitions and theorems.  We will describe Sage's commands applicable when a group action arises naturally via conjugation, and then move into the more general situation in a more general application.     Conjugation as a Group Action  We might think we need to be careful how Sage defines conjugation ( versus ) and the difference between Sage and the text on the order of products. However, if you look at the definition of the center and centralizer subgroups you can see that any difference in ordering is irrelevant. Here are the group action commands for the particular action that is conjugation of the elements of the group.  Sage has a permutation group method .center() which returns the subgroup of fixed points. The permutation group method, .centralizer(g) , returns a subgroup that is the stabilizer of the group element g . Finally, the orbits are given by conjugacy classes, but Sage will not flood you with the full conjugacy classes and instead gives back a list of one element per conjugacy class, the representatives, via the permutation group method .conjugacy_classes_representatives() . You can manually reconstruct a conjugacy class from a representative, as we do in the example below.  Here is an example of the above commands in action. Notice that an abelian group would be a bad choice for this example.         Notice that in the one conjugacy class constructed all the elements have the same cycle structure, which is no accident. Notice too that rep and a are the same element, and the product of the order of the centralizer ( ) and the size of the conjugacy class ( ) equals the order of the group ( ), which is a variant of the conclusion of .  Verify that the following is a demonstration of the class equation in the special case when the action is conjugation, but would be valid for any group, rather than just D .      Graph Automorphisms  As mentioned, group actions can be even more interesting when the set they act on is different from the group itself. One class of examples is the group of symmetries of a geometric solid, where the objects in the set are the vertices of the object, or perhaps some other aspect such as edges, faces or diagonals. In this case, the group is all those permutations that move the solid but leave it filling the same space before the motion ( rigid motions ).  In this section we will examine something very similar. A graph is a mathematical object, consisting of vertices and edges, but the only structure is whether or not any given pair of vertices are joined by an edge or not. The group consists of permutations of vertices that preserve the structure, that is, permutations of vertices that take edges to edges and non-edges to non-edges. It is very similar to a symmetry group, but there is no notion of any geometric relationships being preserved.  Here is an example. You will need to run the first compute cell to define the graph and get a nice graphic representation.    Your plot should look like the vertices and edges of a cube, but may not quite look regular, which is fine, since the geometry is not relevant. Vertices are labeled with strings of three binary digits, or , and any two vertices are connected by an edge if their strings differ in exactly one location. We might expect the group of symmetries to have order , rather than order , given its resemblance to a cube (in appearance and in name). However, when not restricted to rigid motions, we have new permutations that preserve edges. One in particular is to interchange two opposite faces. Locate two -cycles opposite of each other, listed in the same order: and . Notice that each cycle looks very similar, but all the vertices of the first end in a zero and the second cycle has vertices ending in a one.  We can create explicitly the permutation that interchanges these two opposite faces, using a text version of the permutation in cycle notation.   We can use this group to illustrate the relevant Sage commands for group actions.        So this action has only one (big) orbit. This implies that every vertex is like any other. When a permutation group behaves this way, we say the group is transitive .   If every vertex is the same we can compute the stabilizer of any vertex, since they will all be isomorphic. Because vertex is the simplest in some sense, we compute its stabilizer.   That S has elements is no surprise, since the group has order and the size of the lone orbit is . But we can go one step further. The three vertices of the graph attached directly to are , , . Any automorphism of the graph that fixes must then permute the three adjacent vertices. There are possible ways to do this, and you can check that each appears in one of the six elements of the stabilizer. So we can understand a transitive group by considering the smaller stabilizer, and in this case we can see that each element of the stabilizer is determined by how it permutes the neighbors of the stabilized vertex.  Transitive groups are both unusual and important. To contrast, here is a graph automorphism group that is far from transitive (without being trivial). A path is a graph that has all of its vertices in a line. Run the first compute cell to see a path on vertices.    The automorphism group is the trivial identity automorphism (always) and an order permutation that flips the path end-to-end. The group is far from transitive and there are many orbits.    Most of the stabilizers are trivial, with one exception. As subgroups of a group of order , there really are not too many options.    How would this final example have been different if we had used a path on vertices?   NOTE : There was once a small bug with stabilizers being created as subgroups of symmetric groups on fewer symbols than the correct number. This is fixed in Sage 4.8 and newer. Note the correct output below, and you can check your installation by running these commands. If you do not see the singleton [4] in your output, you should definitely update your copy of Sage.    "

A group acts on itself by conjugation via the map . Let be representatives from each of the distinct conjugacy classes of that consist of more than one element. Then the class equation can be written as , where is the center of and is the centralizer subgroup of .  We begin our investigation of the Sylow Theorems by examining subgroups of order , where is prime. A group is a -group Group -group if every element in has as its order a power of , where is a prime number. A subgroup of a group is a -subgroup Subgroup! -subgroup if it is a -group.   Cauchy  Cauchy's Theorem   Let be a finite group and a prime such that divides the order of . Then contains a subgroup of order .    We will use induction on the order of .

We have two cases.   Case 1  Suppose the order of one of the centralizer subgroups, , is divisible by for some , . In this case, by our induction hypothesis, we are done. Since is a proper subgroup of and divides , must contain an element of order . Hence, must contain an element of order .    Case 2  Suppose the order of no centralizer subgroup is divisible by . Then divides , the order of each conjugacy class in the class equation; hence, must divide the center of , . Since is abelian, it must have a subgroup of order by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. Therefore, the center of contains an element of order .       Let be a finite group. Then is a -group if and only if .     Let us consider the group . We know that . By Cauchy's Theorem, we are guaranteed that has subgroups of orders , and . The Sylow Theorems will give us even more information about the possible subgroups of .   We are now ready to state and prove the first of the Sylow Theorems. The proof is very similar to the proof of Cauchy's Theorem.   First Sylow Theorem   Let be a finite group and a prime such that divides . Then contains a subgroup of order .    We induct on the order of once again. If , then we are done. Now suppose that the order of is with and that the theorem is true for all groups of order less than , where divides . We shall apply the class equation once again: . First suppose that does not divide for some . Then , since divides . Now we can apply the induction hypothesis to .  Hence, we may assume that divides for all . Since divides , the class equation says that must divide ; hence, by Cauchy's Theorem, has an element of order , say . Let be the group generated by . Clearly, is a normal subgroup of since is abelian; therefore, is normal in since every element in commutes with every element in . Now consider the factor group of order .

A Sylow -subgroup Subgroup Sylow -subgroup Sylow -subgroup  of a group is a maximal -subgroup of .

Historical Note  Peter Ludvig Mejdell Sylow Sylow, Ludvig was born in 1832 in Christiania, Norway (now Oslo). After attending Christiania University, Sylow taught high school. In 1862 he obtained a temporary appointment at Christiania University. Even though his appointment was relatively brief, he influenced students such as Sophus Lie Lie, Sophus (1842 1899). Sylow had a chance at a permanent chair in 1869, but failed to obtain the appointment. In 1872, he published a 10-page paper presenting the theorems that now bear his name. Later Lie and Sylow collaborated on a new edition of Abel's works. In 1898, a chair at Christiania University was finally created for Sylow through the efforts of his student and colleague Lie. Sylow died in 1918.   "

All Sylow -subgroups are conjugate. If there were only a single Sylow -subgroup, it would be conjugate to itself; that is, it would be a normal subgroup of . Since has no normal subgroups, this is impossible; hence, we have determined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow -subgroups of .   The Sylow Theorems allow us to prove many useful results about finite groups. By using them, we can often conclude a great deal about groups of a particular order if certain hypotheses are satisfied.    If and are distinct primes with , then every group of order has a single subgroup of order and this subgroup is normal in . Hence, cannot be simple. Furthermore, if , then is cyclic.    We know that contains a subgroup of order . The number of conjugates of divides and is equal to for . However, is already too large to divide the order of the group; hence, can only be conjugate to itself. That is, must be normal in .  The group also has a Sylow -subgroup, say .

In this case, we can easily show that satisfies the criteria, given in , for the internal direct product of and . Since is isomorphic to and is isomorphic to , by .     Every group of order is cyclic. This is true because and .    Let us classify all of the groups of order up to isomorphism. First we will show that every group of order is abelian. By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are Sylow -subgroups, each of order , for some . Also, must divide ; hence, there can only be a single normal Sylow -subgroup in . Similarly, there are Sylow -subgroups and must divide . Consequently, there is only one Sylow -subgroup in . By , any group of order is abelian for prime; hence, is isomorphic either to or to . Since has order , it must be isomorphic to . Therefore, the only possible groups of order are or up to isomorphism.   To determine all of the groups of order , we need the following theorem.    Let be the subgroup consisting of all finite products of elements of the form in a group . Then is a normal subgroup of and is abelian.    The subgroup of is called the commutator subgroup Subgroup commutator of . We leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise ( in ).   We will now show that every group of order is abelian, and cyclic by . By the Third Sylow Theorem, has only one subgroup of order . So has order 35 and must be abelian by . Hence, the commutator subgroup of is contained in which tells us that is either or . If , we are done. Suppose that . The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that has only one subgroup of order and one subgroup of order . So there exist normal subgroups and in , where and . In either case the quotient group is abelian; hence, must be a subgroup of , . Therefore, the order of is , , or . However, we already have determined that or . So the commutator subgroup of is trivial, and consequently is abelian.     Finite Simple Groups  Given a finite group, one can ask whether or not that group has any normal subgroups. Recall that a simple group is one with no proper nontrivial normal subgroups. As in the case of , proving a group to be simple can be a very difficult task; however, the Sylow Theorems are useful tools for proving that a group is not simple. Usually, some sort of counting argument is involved.   Let us show that no group of order can be simple. By the Third Sylow Theorem, contains one or more Sylow -subgroups. The number of such subgroups is congruent to and must also divide . The only possible such number is . Since there is only a single Sylow -subgroup and all Sylow -subgroups are conjugate, this subgroup must be normal.    Let be a finite group of order , and prime. By , has a nontrivial center. Since the center of any group is a normal subgroup, cannot be a simple group. Therefore, groups of orders , , , , , , , , , and are not simple. In fact, the groups of order , , , and are abelian by .    No group of order is simple. We have seen that if we can show that there is only one Sylow -subgroup for some prime dividing 56, then this must be a normal subgroup and we are done. By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are either one or eight Sylow -subgroups. If there is only a single Sylow -subgroup, then it must be normal.  On the other hand, suppose that there are eight Sylow -subgroups. Then each of these subgroups must be cyclic; hence, the intersection of any two of these subgroups contains only the identity of the group. This leaves distinct elements in the group, each of order . Now let us count Sylow -subgroups. There are either one or seven Sylow -subgroups. Any element of a Sylow -subgroup other than the identity must have as its order a power of ; and therefore cannot be one of the elements of order in the Sylow -subgroups. Since a Sylow -subgroup has order , there is only enough room for a single Sylow -subgroup in a group of order . If there is only one Sylow -subgroup, it must be normal.   For other groups , it is more difficult to prove that is not simple. Suppose has order . In this case the technique that we employed in the last example will not work. We need the following lemma to prove that no group of order is simple.    Let and be finite subgroups of a group . Then .    Recall that . Certainly, since some element in could be written as the product of different elements in and . It is quite possible that for and . If this is the case, let . Notice that , since is in and is in ; consequently, .  Conversely, let and for . Then , where and . Hence, any element can be written in the form for and , as many times as there are elements in ; that is, times. Therefore, .     To demonstrate that a group of order is not simple, we will show that contains either a normal subgroup of order or a normal subgroup of order . By the Third Sylow Theorem, has either one or three Sylow -subgroups of order . If there is only one subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup.   Suppose that the other case is true, and two of the three Sylow -subgroups are and . We claim that . If , then by , , which is impossible. Notice that has index two in both of and , so is normal in both, and thus and are each in the normalizer of . Because is a subgroup of and because has strictly more than elements, must be a multiple of greater than , as well as dividing . The only possibility is that . Hence, .     The following famous conjecture of Burnside was proved in a long and difficult paper by Feit and Thompson [2].   Odd Order Theorem   Odd Order Theorem    Every finite simple group of nonprime order must be of even order.    The proof of this theorem laid the groundwork for a program in the 1960s and 1970s that classified all finite simple groups. The success of this program is one of the outstanding achievements of modern mathematics.   "

  "body": " Sage   Sylow Subgroups  The Sage permutation group method .sylow_subgroup(p) will return a single Sylow -subgroup. If the prime is not a proper divisor of the group order it returns a subgroup of order , in other words, a trivial subgroup. So be careful about how you construct your primes. Sometimes, you may only want one such Sylow subgroup, since any two Sylow -subgroups are conjugate, and hence isomorphic ( ). This also means we can create other Sylow -subgroups by conjugating the one we have. The permutation group method .conjugate(g) will conjugate the group by g .  With repeated conjugations of a single Sylow -subgroup, we will always create duplicate subgroups. So we need to use a slightly complicated construction to form a list of just the unique subgroups as the list of conjugates. This routine that computes all Sylow -subgroups can be helpful throughout this section. It could be made much more efficient by conjugating by just one element per coset of the normalizer, but it will be sufficient for our purposes here. Be sure to execute the next cell if you are online, so the function is defined for use later.   Lets investigate the Sylow subgroups of the dihedral group . As a group of order , we know by the First Sylow Theorem that there is a Sylow -subgroup of order and a Sylow -subgroup of order . First for , we obtain one Sylow -subgroup, form all the conjugates, and form a list of non-duplicate subgroups. (These commands take a while to execute, so be patient.)     The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that for we would expect or Sylow -subgroups, so our computational result of subgroups is consistent with what the theory predicts. Can you visualize each of these subgroups as symmetries of an -gon? Notice that we also have many subgroups of order inside of these subgroups of order .  Now for the case of .     What does the Third Sylow Theorem predict? Just or Sylow -subgroups. Having found just one subgroup computationally, we know that all of the conjugates of the lone Sylow -subgroup are equal. In other words, the Sylow -subgroup is normal in . Let us check anyway.   At least one of the subgroups of order contained in this Sylow -subgroup should be obvious by looking at the orders of the generators, and then you may even notice that the generators given could be reduced, and one is a power of the other.   Remember that there are many other subgroups, of other orders. For example, can you construct a subgroup of order in ?    Normalizers  A new command that is relevant to this section is the construction of a normalizer. The Sage command G.normalizer(H) will return the subgroup of G containing elements that normalize the subgroup H . We illustrate its use with the Sylow subgroups from above.      The normalizer of a subgroup always contains the whole subgroup, so the normalizer of S2 is as small as possible. We already knew S3 is normal in G , so it is no surprise that its normalizer is as big as possible every element of G normalizes S3 . Let us compute a normalizer in that is more interesting.      So for this subgroup of order , the normalizer is strictly bigger than the subgroup, but still strictly smaller than the whole group (and hence not normal in the dihedral group). Trivially, a subgroup is normal in its normalizer:      Finite Simple Groups  We saw earlier Sage's permutation group method .is_simple() . tells us that a group of order is never simple. The dicyclic group DiCyclicGroup(16) is a non-abelian group of , so we can test this method on this group. It turns out this group has many normal subgroups the list will always contain the trivial subgroup and the group itself, so any number exceeding indicates a non-trivial normal subgroup.     Here is a rather interesting group, one of the sporadic simple groups, known as the Higman-Sims group, . The generators used below come from the representation on 100 points in GAP format, available off of web.mat.bham.ac.uk\/atlas\/v2.0\/spor\/HS\/ . Two generators of just order and order (as you can esily see), generating exactly elements, but no normal subgroups. Amazing.     We saw this group earlier in the exercises for on group actions, where it was the single non-trivial normal subgroup of the automorphism group of the Higman-Sims graph, hence its name.    GAP Console and Interface  This concludes our exclusive study of group theory, though we will be using groups some in the subsequent sections. As we have remarked, much of Sage's computation with groups is performed by the open source program, Groups, Algorithms, and Programming, which is better know as simply GAP . If after this course you outgrow Sage's support for groups, then learning GAP would be your next step as a group theorist. Every copy of Sage includes a copy of GAP and is easy to see which version of GAP is included:   You can interact with GAP in Sage in several ways. The most direct is by creating a permutation group via Sage's gap() command.   Now we can use most any GAP command with G , via the convention that most GAP commands expect a group as the first argument, and we instead provide the group by using the object-oriented G. syntax. If you consult the GAP documentation you will see that Center is a GAP command that expects a group as its lone argument, and Centralizer is a GAP command that expects two arguments a group and then a group element.    If you use the Sage Notebook interface you can set the first line of a compute cell to %gap and the entire cell will be interpreted as if you were interacting directly with GAP . This means you would now use GAP 's syntax, which you can see above is slightly different than Sage's universal syntax. You can also use the drop-down box at the top of a worksheet, and select gap as the system (rather than sage ) and your whole worksheet will be interpreted as GAP commands. Here is one simple example, which you should be able to evaluate in your current worksheet. This particular example will not run properly in a Sage Cell in a web page version of this section.   Notice that   We do not need to wrap the individual permutations in as many quotation marks as we do in Sage.    Assignment is := not = . If you forget the colon, you will get an error message such as Variable: 'G' must have a value     A line must end with a semi-colon. If you forget, several lines will be merged together.     You can get help about GAP commands with a command such as the following, though you will soon see that GAP assumes you know a lot more algebra than Sage assumes you know.   In the command-line version of Sage, you can also use the GAP  console. Again, you need to use GAP syntax, and you do not have many of the conveniences of the Sage notebook. It is also good to know in advance that quit; is how you can leave the GAP console and get back to Sage. If you run Sage at the command-line, use the command gap_console() to start GAP running.  It is a comfort to know that with Sage you get a complete copy of GAP , installed and all ready to run. However, this is not a tutorial on GAP , so consult the documentation available at the main GAP website: www.gap-system.org to learn how to get the most out of GAP .   "

  "body": " Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals  In the study of groups, a homomorphism is a map that preserves the operation of the group. Similarly, a homomorphism between rings preserves the operations of addition and multiplication in the ring. More specifically, if and are rings, then a ring homomorphism Homomorphism ring Ring homomorphism is a map satisfying for all . If is a one-to-one and onto homomorphism, then is called an isomorphism Isomorphism ring Ring isomorphism of rings.  The set of elements that a ring homomorphism maps to plays a fundamental role in the theory of rings. For any ring homomorphism , we define the kernel Homomorphism kernel of a ring Kernel of a ring homomorphism of a ring homomorphism to be the set .   For any integer we can define a ring homomorphism by . This is indeed a ring homomorphism, since and . The kernel of the homomorphism is .    Let be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on an interval as in . For a fixed , we can define a ring homomorphism by . This is a ring homomorphism since . Ring homomorphisms of the type are called Homomorphism evaluation evaluation homomorphisms .   In the next proposition we will examine some fundamental properties of ring homomorphisms. The proof of the proposition is left as an exercise.    Let be a ring homomorphism.   If is a commutative ring, then is a commutative ring.     .    Let and be the identities for and , respectively. If is onto, then .    If is a field and , then is a field.         In group theory we found that normal subgroups play a special role. These subgroups have nice characteristics that make them more interesting to study than arbitrary subgroups. In ring theory the objects corresponding to normal subgroups are a special class of subrings called ideals. An ideal Ideal definition of in a ring is a subring of such that if is in and is in , then both and are in ; that is, and for all .   Every ring has at least two ideals, and . These ideals are called the Ideal trivial trivial ideals .     Let be a ring with identity and suppose that is an ideal in such that is in . Since for any , by the definition of an ideal, .   If is any element in a commutative ring with identity, then the set is an ideal in . Certainly, is nonempty since both and are in . The sum of two elements in is again in since . The inverse of is . Finally, if we multiply an element by an arbitrary element , we have . Therefore, satisfies the definition of an ideal.   If is a commutative ring with identity, then an ideal of the form is called a Ideal principal Principal ideal principal ideal .    Every ideal in the ring of integers is a principal ideal.    The zero ideal is a principal ideal since . If is any nonzero ideal in , then must contain some positive integer . There exists a least positive integer in by the Principle of Well-Ordering. Now let be any element in . Using the division algorithm, we know that there exist integers and such that where . This equation tells us that , but must be since is the least positive element in . Therefore, and .       The set is ideal in the ring of integers. If is in and is in , then is in as required. In fact, by , these are the only ideals of .     The kernel of any ring homomorphism is an ideal in .    We know from group theory that is an additive subgroup of . Suppose that and . Then we must show that and are in . However, and .     In our definition of an ideal we have required that and for all . Such ideals are sometimes referred to as Ideal two-sided two-sided ideals . We can also consider one-sided ideals ; Ideal one-sided that is, we may require only that either or for hold but not both. Such ideals are called left ideals and right ideals , respectively. Of course, in a commutative ring any ideal must be two-sided. In this text we will concentrate on two-sided ideals.     Let be an ideal of . The factor group is a ring with multiplication defined by .    We already know that is an abelian group under addition. Let and be in .

The ring in is called the factor Ring factor or Ring quotient quotient ring . Just as with group homomorphisms and normal subgroups, there is a relationship between ring homomorphisms and ideals.

Historical Note  Amalie Emmy Noether, Noether, A. Emmy one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century, was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882. She was the daughter of Max Noether Noether, Max (1844 1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen. Together with Paul Gordon (1837 1912), Emmy Noether's father strongly influenced her early education. She entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18. Although women had been admitted to universities in England, France, and Italy for decades, there was great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany. Noether was one of only two women among the university's 986 students. After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907, she continued to do research at Erlangen, occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.  Noether went to Göttingen to study in 1916. David Hilbert Hilbert, David and Felix Klein Klein, Felix tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at Göttingen. Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying, What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman? Hilbert, annoyed at the question, responded, Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent. After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse. At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women. After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919, she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures.  In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Göttingen. Over the next 11 years she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals. Though she was not good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher. One of her many students was B. L. van der Waerden, author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of view. Some of the other mathematicians Noether influenced or closely worked with were Alexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin, von Neumann, and Weyl. One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932. In spite of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether's abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her lifetime. She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.  In 1933, Noether, who was Jewish, was banned from participation in all academic activities in Germany. She emigrated to the United States, took a position at Bryn Mawr College, and became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Noether died suddenly on April 14, 1935. After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.   "

  "body": " An Application to Software Design  The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a result from elementary number theory about the solution of systems of simultaneous congruences. The Chinese mathematician Sun-tsï wrote about the theorem in the first century A.D. This theorem has some interesting consequences in the design of software for parallel processors.    Let and be positive integers such that . Then for the system has a solution. If and are two solutions of the system, then .    The equation has a solution since satisfies the equation for all . We must show that there exists an integer such that . This is equivalent to showing that has a solution for . Since and are relatively prime, there exist integers and such that . Consequently, , or . Now let .  To show that any two solutions are congruent modulo , let and be two solutions of the system. That is, for . Then . Therefore, both and divide . Consequently, .     Let us solve the system . Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find integers and such that . Two such integers are and . Consequently, .      Chinese Remainder Theorem   Chinese Remainder Theorem  for integers    Let be positive integers such that for . Then for any integers , the system has a solution. Furthermore, any two solutions of the system are congruent modulo .    We will use mathematical induction on the number of equations in the system. If there are equations, then the theorem is true by . Now suppose that the result is true for a system of equations or less and that we wish to find a solution of . Considering the first equations, there exists a solution that is unique modulo , say . Since and are relatively prime, the system has a solution that is unique modulo by the lemma.     Let us solve the system . From we know that is a solution of the first two congruences and any other solution of the system is congruent to . Hence, we can reduce the system to a system of three congruences: . Solving the next two equations, we can reduce the system to . Solving this last system, we find that is a solution for the system that is unique up to modulo .   One interesting application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the design of computer software is that the theorem allows us to break up a calculation involving large integers into several less formidable calculations. A computer will handle integer calculations only up to a certain size due to the size of its processor chip, which is usually a 32 or 64-bit processor chip. For example, the largest integer available on a computer with a 64-bit processor chip is . Larger processors such as 128 or 256-bit have been proposed or are under development. There is even talk of a 512-bit processor chip. The largest integer that such a chip could store with be , which would be a 154 digit number. However, we would need to deal with much larger numbers to break sophisticated encryption schemes.  Special software is required for calculations involving larger integers which cannot be added directly by the machine. By using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we can break down large integer additions and multiplications into calculations that the computer can handle directly. This is especially useful on parallel processing computers which have the ability to run several programs concurrently.  Most computers have a single central processing unit (CPU) containing one processor chip and can only add two numbers at a time. To add a list of ten numbers, the CPU must do nine additions in sequence. However, a parallel processing computer has more than one CPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example, can perform 10 different additions at the same time. If we can take a large integer and break it down into parts, sending each part to a different CPU, then by performing several additions or multiplications simultaneously on those parts, we can work with an integer that the computer would not be able to handle as a whole.   Suppose that we wish to multiply by . We will use the integers , , , and because they are relatively prime. We can break down each integer into four parts: and . Multiplying the corresponding equations, we obtain . Each of these four computations can be sent to a different processor if our computer has several CPUs. By the above calculation, we know that is a solution of the system . The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that solutions are unique up to modulo . Solving this system of congruences for tells us that .  The conversion of the computation into the four subcomputations will take some computing time. In addition, solving the system of congruences can also take considerable time. However, if we have many computations to be performed on a particular set of numbers, it makes sense to transform the problem as we have done above and to perform the necessary calculations simultaneously.

  "body": " Sage   Rings are very important in your study of abstract algebra, and similarly, they are very important in the design and use of Sage. There is a lot of material in this chapter, and there are many corresponding commands in Sage.    Creating Rings  Here is a list of various rings, domains and fields you can construct simply.    Integers() , ZZ : the integral domain of positive and negative integers, .     Integers(n) : the integers mod , . A field when is prime, but just a ring for composite .     QQ : the field of rational numbers, .     RR , CC : the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers, , . It is impossible to create every real number inside a computer, so technically these sets do not behave as fields, but only give a good imitiation of the real thing. We say they are inexact rings to make this point.     QuadraticField(n) : the field formed by combining the rationals with a solution to the polynomial equation . The notation in the text is . A functional equivalent can be made with the syntax QQ[sqrt(n)] . Note that n can be negative.     CyclotomicField(n) : the field formed by combining the rationals with the solutions to the polynomial equation .     QQbar : the field formed by combining the rationals with the solutions to every polynomial equation with integer coefficients. This is known as a the field of algebraic numbers, denoted as .     FiniteField(p) : for a prime , the field of integers .     If you print a description of some of the above rings, you will sometimes see a new symbol introduced. Consider the following example:      Here Number Field describes an object generally formed by combining the rationals with another number (here ). a is a new symbol which behaves as a root of the polynomial . We do not say which root, or , and as we understand the theory better we will see that this does not really matter.  We can obtain this root as a generator of the number field, and then manipulate it. First squaring root yields 7. Notice that root prints as a . Notice, too, that computations with root behave as if it was either root of , and results print using a .  This can get a bit confusing, inputing computations with root and getting output in terms of a . Fortunately, there is a better way. Consider the following example:     With the syntax F.<b> we can create the field F along with specifying a generator b using a name of our choosing. Then computations can use b in both input and output as a root of .  Here are three new rings that are best created using this new syntax.    F.<a> = FiniteField(p^n) : We will later have a theorem that tells us that finite fields only exist with orders equal to to a power of a prime. When the power is larger than 1, then we need a generator, here given as a .     P.<x>=R[] : the ring of all polynomials in the variable x , with coefficients from the ring R . Notice that R can be any ring, so this is a very general construction that uses one ring to form another. See an example below.     Q.<r,s,t> = QuaternionAlgebra(n, m) : the rationals combined with indeterminates r , s and t such that , and . This is a generalization of the quaternions described in this chapter, though over the rationals rather than the reals, so it is an exact ring. Notice that this is one of the few noncommutative rings in Sage. The usual quaternions would be constructed with Q.<I,J,K> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1, -1) . (Notice that using I here is not a good choice, because it will then clobber the symbol I used for complex numbers.)     Syntax specifying names for generators can be used for many of the above rings as well, such as demonstrated above for quadratic fields and below for cyclotomic fields.     Properties of Rings  The examples below demonstrate how to query certain properties of rings. If you are playing along, be sure to execute the first compute cell to define the various rings involved in the examples.   Exact versus inexact.    Finite versus infinite.    Integral domain?    Field?     Commutative?    Characteristic.        Additive and multiplicative identities print like you would expect, but notice that while they may print identically, they could be different because of the ring they live in.            There is some support for subrings. For example, Q and S are extensions of the rationals, while F is totally distinct from the rationals.     Not every element of a ring may have a multiplicative inverse, in other words, not every element has to be a unit (unless the ring is a field). It would now be good practice to check if an element is a unit before you try computing its inverse.         Quotient Structure  Ideals are the normal subgroups of rings and allow us to build quotients  basically new rings defined on equivalence classes of elements of the original ring. Sage support for ideals is variable. When they can be created, there is not always a lot you can do with them. But they work well in certain very important cases.  The integers, , have ideals that are just multiples of a single integer. We can create them with the .ideal() method or just by wrting a scalar multiple of ZZ . And then the quotient is isomorphic to a well-understood ring. (Notice that I is a bad name for an ideal if we want to work with complex numbers later.)      We might normally be more careful about the last statement. The quotient is a set of equivalence classes, each infinite, and certainly not a single integer. But the quotient is isomorphic to , so Sage just makes this identification.      Notice that the construction of the quotient ring has created a new generator, converting y ( ) to ybar ( ). We can override this as before with the syntax demonstrated below.    So from a quotient of an infinite ring and an ideal (which is also a ring), we create a field, which is finite. Understanding this construction will be an important theme in the next few chapters. To see how remarkable it is, consider what happens with just one little change.      There are a few methods available which will give us properties of ideals. In particular, we can check for prime and maximal ideals in rings of polynomials. Examine the results above and below in the context of .    The fact that M is a prime ideal is verification of .      Ring Homomorphisms  When Sage is presented with 3 + 4\/3 , how does it know that 3 is meant to be an integer? And then to add it to a rational, how does it know that we really want to view the computation as 3\/1 + 4\/3? This is really easy for you and me, but devilishly hard for a program, and you can imagine it getting ever more complicated with the many possible rings in Sage, subrings, matrices, etc. Part of the answer is that Sage uses ring homomorphisms to translate objects (numbers) between rings.  We will give an example below, but not pursue the topic much further. For the curious, reading the Sage documentation and experimenting would be a good exercise.        So phi is a homomorphism ( morphism ) that converts integers (the domain is ZZ ) into rationals (the codomain is QQ ), whose parent is a set of homomorphisms that Sage calls a homset. Even though a and b both print as 3 , which is indistinguishable to our eyes, the parents of a and b are different. Yet the numerical value of the two objects has not changed.   "

Let be the smallest value of such that . Then is not divisible by , since each term on the right-hand side of the equation is divisible by except for . Therefore, since is divisible by for . Hence, cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree and therefore must be irreducible.     The polynomial is easily seen to be irreducible over by Eisenstein's Criterion if we let .      Eisenstein's Criterion is more useful in constructing irreducible polynomials of a certain degree over than in determining the irreducibility of an arbitrary polynomial in : given an arbitrary polynomial, it is not very likely that we can apply Eisenstein's Criterion. The real value of is that we now have an easy method of generating irreducible polynomials of any degree.    Ideals in  Let be a field. Recall that a principal ideal in is an ideal generated by some polynomial ; that is, .   The polynomial in generates the ideal consisting of all polynomials with no constant term or term of degree .     If is a field, then every ideal in is a principal ideal.    Let be an ideal of . If is the zero ideal, the theorem is easily true. Suppose that is a nontrivial ideal in , and let be a nonzero element of minimal degree. If , then is a nonzero constant and 1 must be in . Since 1 generates all of , and is again a principal ideal.  Now assume that and let be any element in . By the division algorithm there exist and in such that and . Since and is an ideal, is also in . However, since we chose to be of minimal degree, must be the zero polynomial. Since we can write any element in as for some , it must be the case that .     It is not the case that every ideal in the ring is a principal ideal. Consider the ideal of generated by the polynomials and . This is the ideal of consisting of all polynomials with no constant term. Since both and are in the ideal, no single polynomial can generate the entire ideal.     Let be a field and suppose that . Then the ideal generated by is maximal if and only if is irreducible.    Suppose that generates a maximal ideal of . Then is also a prime ideal of . Since a maximal ideal must be properly contained inside , cannot be a constant polynomial. Let us assume that factors into two polynomials of lesser degree, say . Since is a prime ideal one of these factors, say , is in and therefore be a multiple of . But this would imply that , which is impossible since is maximal.  Conversely, suppose that is irreducible over . Let be an ideal in containing . By , is a principal ideal; hence, for some . Since , it must be the case that for some . However, is irreducible; hence, either or is a constant polynomial. If is constant, then and we are done. If is constant, then is a constant multiple of and . Thus, there are no proper ideals of that properly contain .      Historical Note  Throughout history, the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem. The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation . Omar Khayyam (1048 1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions and conic sections. The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation was not discovered until the sixteenth century. An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca. 1445 1509), wrote in Summa de Arithmetica that the solution of the cubic was impossible. This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.   Scipione del Ferro Ferro, Scipione del (1465 1526), of the University of Bologna, solved the depressed cubic,  . He kept his solution an absolute secret. This may seem surprising today, when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results, but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary. Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests. Such challenges could be issued at any time. Consequently, any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest. If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved, del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics. He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life, passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior Fior, Antonio (ca. 1506 ?).  Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher, he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499 1557). Fontana was known as Tartaglia Tartaglia (the Stammerer). As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village. He survived the savage wound, but his speech was permanently impaired. Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics. Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail. After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior, who faded into obscurity.  At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano Cardano, Gerolamo (1501 1576), entered the story. Cardano wrote to Tartaglia, begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic. Tartaglia refused several of his requests, then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else. Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic . Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari Ferrari, Ludovico (1522 1565), who solved the general quartic equation, . In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro's papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic. Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia, so he proceeded to publish the solutions in Ars Magna (1545), in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic. This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia, who published the story of the oath a year later.   "

  "body": " Sage   Sage is particularly adept at building, analyzing and manipulating polynomial rings. We have seen some of this in the previous chapter. Let's begin by creating three polynomial rings and checking some of their basic properties. There are several ways to construct polynomial rings, but the syntax used here is the most straightforward.    Polynomial Rings and their Elements     Basic properties of rings are availble for these examples.        With the construction syntax used above, the variables can be used to create elements of the polynomial ring without explicit coercion (though we need to be careful about constant polynomials).        Polynomials can be evaluated like they are functions, so we can mimic the evaluation homomorphism.     Notice that p is a degree two polynomial, yet through a brute-force examination we see that the polynomial only has one root, contrary to our usual expectations. It can be even more unusual.   Sage can create and manipulate rings of polynomials in more than one variable, though we will not have much occasion to use this functionality in this course.     Irreducible Polynomials  Whether or not a polynomial factors, taking into consideration the ring used for its coefficients, is an important topic in this chapter and many of the following chapters. Sage can factor, and determine irreducibility, over the integers, the rationals, and finite fields.  First, over the rationals.      Factoring over the integers is really no different than factoring over the rationals. This is the content of  finding a factorization over the integers can be converted to finding a factorization over the rationals. So it is with Sage, there is little difference between working over the rationals and the integers. It is a little different working over a finite field. Commentary follows.       To check these factorizations, we need to compute in the finite field, F , and so we need to know how the symbol a behaves. This symbol is considered as a root of a degree two polynomial over the integers mod 5, which we can get with the .modulus() method.   So , or . So when checking the factorizations, anytime you see an you can replace it by . Notice that by we could find the one linear factor of r , and the four linear factors of s , through a brute-force search for roots. This is feasible because the field is finite.    However, q factors into a pair of degree 2 polynomials, so no amount of testing for roots will discover a factor.  With Eisenstein's Criterion, we can create irreducible polynomials, such as in .   Over the field , the field of integers mod a prime , Conway polynomials are canonical choices of a polynomial of degree that is irreducible over . See the exercises for more about these polynomials.    Polynomials over Fields  If is a field, then every ideal of is principal ( ). Nothing stops you from giving Sage two (or more) generators to construct an ideal, but Sage will determine the element to use in a description of the ideal as a principal ideal.     is the key fact that allows us to easily construct finite fields. Here is a construction of a finite field of order . All we need is a polynomial of degree that is irreducible over .      The symbol xbar is a generator of the field, but right now it is not accessible. xbar is the coset . A better construction would include specifying this generator.           "

  "body": " Fields of Fractions  Every field is also an integral domain; however, there are many integral domains that are not fields. For example, the integers form an integral domain but not a field. A question that naturally arises is how we might associate an integral domain with a field. There is a natural way to construct the rationals from the integers: the rationals can be represented as formal quotients of two integers. The rational numbers are certainly a field. In fact, it can be shown that the rationals are the smallest field that contains the integers. Given an integral domain , our question now becomes how to construct a smallest field containing . We will do this in the same way as we constructed the rationals from the integers.  An element is the quotient of two integers and ; however, different pairs of integers can represent the same rational number. For instance, . We know that if and only if . A more formal way of considering this problem is to examine fractions in terms of equivalence relations. We can think of elements in as ordered pairs in . A quotient can be written as . For instance, would represent the fraction . However, there are problems if we consider all possible pairs in . There is no fraction corresponding to the pair . Also, the pairs and both represent the fraction . The first problem is easily solved if we require the second coordinate to be nonzero. The second problem is solved by considering two pairs and to be equivalent if .  If we use the approach of ordered pairs instead of fractions, then we can study integral domains in general. Let be any integral domain and let . Define a relation on by if .    The relation between elements of is an equivalence relation.    Since is commutative, ; hence, is reflexive on . Now suppose that . Then or . Therefore, and the relation is symmetric. Finally, to show that the relation is transitive, let and . In this case and . Multiplying both sides of by yields . Since is an integral domain, we can deduce that or .    We will denote the set of equivalence classes on by . We now need to define the operations of addition and multiplication on . Recall how fractions are added and multiplied in : . It seems reasonable to define the operations of addition and multiplication on in a similar manner. If we denote the equivalence class of by , then we are led to define the operations of addition and multiplication on by and , respectively. The next lemma demonstrates that these operations are independent of the choice of representatives from each equivalence class.    The operations of addition and multiplication on are well-defined.    We will prove that the operation of addition is well-defined. The proof that multiplication is well-defined is left as an exercise. Let and . We must show that or, equivalently, that . Since and , we know that and . Therefore, .      The set of equivalence classes of , , under the equivalence relation , together with the operations of addition and multiplication defined by , is a field.    The additive and multiplicative identities are and , respectively. To show that is the additive identity, observe that . It is easy to show that is the multiplicative identity. Let such that . Then is also in and ; hence, is the multiplicative inverse for . Similarly, is the additive inverse of . We leave as exercises the verification of the associative and commutative properties of multiplication in . We also leave it to the reader to show that is an abelian group under addition.  It remains to show that the distributive property holds in ; however, and the lemma is proved.    The field in is called the field of fractions Field of fractions or field of quotients Field of quotients of the integral domain .    Let be an integral domain. Then can be embedded in a field of fractions , where any element in can be expressed as the quotient of two elements in . Furthermore, the field of fractions is unique in the sense that if is any field containing , then there exists a map giving an isomorphism with a subfield of such that for all elements , where we identify with its image in .

  "body": " Factorization in Integral Domains   The building blocks of the integers are the prime numbers. If is a field, then irreducible polynomials in play a role that is very similar to that of the prime numbers in the ring of integers. Given an arbitrary integral domain, we are led to the following series of definitions.  Let be a commutative ring with identity, and let and be elements in . We say that  divides  , and write , if there exists an element such that . A unit Unit in is an element that has a multiplicative inverse. Two elements and in are said to be associates Element associate Associate elements if there exists a unit in such that .  Let be an integral domain. A nonzero element that is not a unit is said to be irreducible Element irreducible Irreducible element provided that whenever , either or is a unit. Furthermore, is prime Prime element Element prime if whenever either or .   It is important to notice that prime and irreducible elements do not always coincide. Let be the subring (with identity) of generated by , , and . Each of these elements is irreducible in ; however, is not prime, since divides but does not divide either or .    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer can be factored into a product of prime numbers , where the 's are not necessarily distinct. We also know that such factorizations are unique up to the order of the 's. We can easily extend this result to the integers. The question arises of whether or not such factorizations are possible in other rings. Generalizing this definition, we say an integral domain is a unique factorization domain , Unique factorization domain ( UFD ) Domain unique factorization or UFD , if satisfies the following criteria.   Let such that and is not a unit. Then can be written as the product of irreducible elements in .     Let , where the 's and the 's are irreducible. Then and there is a such that and are associates for .      The integers are a unique factorization domain by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.    Not every integral domain is a unique factorization domain. The subring of the complex numbers is an integral domain ( , ). Let and define by . It is clear that with equality when . Also, from our knowledge of complex numbers we know that . It is easy to show that if , then is a unit, and that the only units of are and .  We claim that has two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements: . We must show that each of these factors is an irreducible element in . If is not irreducible, then for elements in where . However, there does not exist an element in in such that because the equation has no integer solutions. Therefore, must be irreducible. A similar argument shows that both and are irreducible. Since is not a unit multiple of either or , has at least two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements.     Principal Ideal Domains  Let be a commutative ring with identity. Recall that a principal ideal generated by is an ideal of the form . An integral domain in which every ideal is principal is called a principal ideal domain , Principal ideal domain ( PID ) Domain principal ideal or PID .    Let be an integral domain and let . Then    if and only if .     and are associates if and only if .     is a unit in if and only if .       (1) Suppose that . Then for some . Hence, for every in , and . Conversely, suppose that . Then . Consequently, for some . Thus, .  (2) Since and are associates, there exists a unit such that . Therefore, and . Similarly, . It follows that . Conversely, suppose that . By part (1), and . Then and for some . Therefore, . Since is an integral domain, ; that is, and are units and and are associates.  (3) An element is a unit if and only if is an associate of . However, is an associate of if and only if .      Let be a PID and be a nonzero ideal in . Then is a maximal ideal if and only if is irreducible.    Suppose that is a maximal ideal. If some element in divides , then . Since is maximal, either or . Consequently, either and are associates or is a unit. Therefore, is irreducible.  Conversely, let be irreducible. If is an ideal in such that , then . Since is irreducible, either must be a unit or and are associates. Therefore, either or . Thus, is a maximal ideal.      Let be a PID . If is irreducible, then is prime.    Let be irreducible and suppose that . Then . By , since is a maximal ideal, must also be a prime ideal. Thus, either or . Hence, either or .      Let be a PID . Let be a set of ideals such that . Then there exists an integer such that for all .    We claim that is an ideal of . Certainly is not empty, since and . If , then and for some and in . Without loss of generality we can assume that . Hence, and are both in and so is also in . Now let and . Again, we note that for some positive integer . Since is an ideal, and hence must be in . Therefore, we have shown that is an ideal in .   Since is a principal ideal domain, there exists an element that generates . Since is in for some , we know that . Consequently, for .    Any commutative ring satisfying the condition in is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition , Ascending chain condition or ACC . Such rings are called Noetherian rings , Ring Noetherian after Emmy Noether.    Every PID is a UFD .     Existence of a factorization  Let be a PID and be a nonzero element in that is not a unit. If is irreducible, then we are done. If not, then there exists a factorization , where neither nor is a unit. Hence, . By , we know that ; otherwise, and would be associates and would be a unit, which would contradict our assumption. Now suppose that , where neither nor is a unit. By the same argument as before, . We can continue with this construction to obtain an ascending chain of ideals . By , there exists a positive integer such that for all . Consequently, must be irreducible. We have now shown that is the product of two elements, one of which must be irreducible.    Now suppose that , where is irreducible. If is not a unit, we can repeat the preceding argument to conclude that . Either is irreducible or , where is irreducible and is not a unit. Continuing in this manner, we obtain another chain of ideals . This chain must satisfy the ascending chain condition; therefore, for irreducible elements .    Uniqueness of the factorization  To show uniqueness, let , where each and each is irreducible. Without loss of generality, we can assume that . Since divides , by it must divide some . By rearranging the 's, we can assume that ; hence, for some unit in . Therefore, or . Continuing in this manner, we can arrange the 's such that , to obtain . In this case is a unit, which contradicts the fact that are irreducibles. Therefore, and the factorization of is unique.         Let be a field. Then is a UFD .     Every PID is a UFD , but it is not the case that every UFD is a PID . In , we will prove that is a UFD . However, is not a PID . Let . We can easily show that is an ideal of . Suppose that . Since , . In this case must be a constant. Since , ; consequently, . However, it follows from this fact that . But this would mean that is in . Therefore, we can write for some and in . Examining the constant term of this polynomial, we see that , which is impossible.     Euclidean Domains  We have repeatedly used the division algorithm when proving results about either or , where is a field. We should now ask when a division algorithm is available for an integral domain.  Let be an integral domain such that there is a function satisfying the following conditions.   Euclidean valuation of     If and are nonzero elements in , then .    Let and suppose that . Then there exist elements such that and either or .   Then is called a Euclidean domain Euclidean domain Domain Euclidean and is called a Euclidean valuation Euclidean valuation .   Absolute value on is a Euclidean valuation.    Let be a field. Then the degree of a polynomial in is a Euclidean valuation.    Recall that the Gaussian integers in of are defined by . We usually measure the size of a complex number by its absolute value,. ; however, may not be an integer. For our valuation we will let to ensure that we have an integer.  We claim that is a Euclidean valuation on . Let . Then . Since for every nonzero , .    Next, we must show that for any and in with , there exist elements and in such that with either or . We can view and as elements in , the field of fractions of . Observe that in . In the last steps we are writing the real and imaginary parts as an integer plus a proper fraction. That is, we take the closest integer such that the fractional part satisfies . For example, we write . Thus, and are the fractional parts of . We also know that . Multiplying by , we have , where and . Since and are in , must be in . Finally, we need to show that either or . However, .     Every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain.    Let be a Euclidean domain and let be a Euclidean valuation on . Suppose is a nontrivial ideal in and choose a nonzero element such that is minimal for all . Since is a Euclidean domain, there exist elements and in such that and either or . But is in since is an ideal; therefore, by the minimality of . It follows that and .      Every Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain.      Factorization in  One of the most important polynomial rings is . One of the first questions that come to mind about is whether or not it is a UFD . We will prove a more general statement here. Our first task is to obtain a more general version of Gauss's Lemma ( ).  Let be a unique factorization domain and suppose that in . Then the content Polynomial content of of is the greatest common divisor of . We say that is primitive Primitive polynomial Polynomial primitive if .     In the polynomial is a primitive polynomial since the greatest common divisor of the coefficients is ; however, the polynomial is not primitive since the content of is .    Gauss's Lemma   Gauss's Lemma    Let be a UFD and let and be primitive polynomials in . Then is primitive.    Let and . Suppose that is a prime dividing the coefficients of . Let be the smallest integer such that and be the smallest integer such that . The coefficient of in is . Since divides and , divides every term of except for the term . However, since , either divides or divides . But this is impossible.      Let be a UFD , and let and be in . Then the content of is equal to the product of the contents of and .    Let and , where and are the contents of and , respectively. Then and are primitive. We can now write . Since is primitive, the content of must be .      Let be a UFD and its field of fractions. Suppose that and , where and are in . Then , where and are in . Furthermore, and .    Let and be nonzero elements of such that are in . We can find such that and , where and are primitive polynomials in . Therefore, . Since and are primitive polynomials, it must be the case that by Gauss's Lemma. Thus there exists a such that . Clearly, and .    The following corollaries are direct consequences of .    Let be a UFD and its field of fractions. A primitive polynomial in is irreducible in if and only if it is irreducible in .      Let be a UFD and its field of fractions. If is a monic polynomial in with in , then , where and are in . Furthermore, and .      If is a UFD , then is a UFD .    Let be a nonzero polynomial in . If is a constant polynomial, then it must have a unique factorization since is a UFD . Now suppose that is a polynomial of positive degree in . Let be the field of fractions of , and let by a factorization of , where each is irreducible. Choose such that is in . There exist such that , where is a primitive polynomial in . By , each is irreducible in . Consequently, we can write . Let . Since is primitive, divides . Therefore, , where . Since is a UFD , we can factor as , where is a unit and each of the 's is irreducible in .  We will now show the uniqueness of this factorization. Let be two factorizations of , where all of the factors are irreducible in . By , each of the 's and 's is irreducible in . The 's and the 's are units in . Since is a PID , it is a UFD ; therefore, . Now rearrange the 's so that and are associates for . Then there exist and in such that or . The polynomials and are primitive; hence, and are associates in . Thus, in , where is a unit in . Since is a unique factorization domain, . Finally, we can reorder the 's so that and are associates for each . This completes the uniqueness part of the proof.    The theorem that we have just proven has several obvious but important corollaries.    Let be a field. Then is a UFD .      The ring of polynomials over the integers, , is a UFD .      Let be a UFD . Then is a UFD .     It is important to notice that every Euclidean domain is a PID and every PID is a UFD . However, the converse of each of these statements fails. There are principal ideal domains that are not Euclidean domains, and there are unique factorization domains that are not principal ideal domains ( ).     Historical Note  Karl Friedrich Gauss, Gauss, Karl Friedrich born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777, is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Gauss was truly a child prodigy. At the age of three he was able to detect errors in the books of his father's business. Gauss entered college at the age of 15. Before the age of 20, Gauss was able to construct a regular -sided polygon with a ruler and compass. This was the first new construction of a regular -sided polygon since the time of the ancient Greeks. Gauss succeeded in showing that if was prime, then it was possible to construct a regular -sided polygon.  Gauss obtained his Ph.D. in 1799 under the direction of Pfaff at the University of Helmstedt. In his dissertation he gave the first complete proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into linear factors over the complex numbers. The acceptance of complex numbers was brought about by Gauss, who was the first person to use the notation of for .  Gauss then turned his attention toward number theory; in 1801, he published his famous book on number theory, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae . Throughout his life Gauss was intrigued with this branch of mathematics. He once wrote, Mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and the theory of numbers is the queen of mathematics.   In 1807, Gauss was appointed director of the Observatory at the University of Göttingen, a position he held until his death. This position required him to study applications of mathematics to the sciences. He succeeded in making contributions to fields such as astronomy, mechanics, optics, geodesy, and magnetism. Along with Wilhelm Weber, he coinvented the first practical electric telegraph some years before a better version was invented by Samuel F. B. Morse.  Gauss was clearly the most prominent mathematician in the world in the early nineteenth century. His status naturally made his discoveries subject to intense scrutiny. Gauss's cold and distant personality many times led him to ignore the work of his contemporaries, making him many enemies. He did not enjoy teaching very much, and young mathematicians who sought him out for encouragement were often rebuffed. Nevertheless, he had many outstanding students, including Eisenstein, Riemann, Kummer, Dirichlet, and Dedekind. Gauss also offered a great deal of encouragement to Sophie Germain (1776 1831), who overcame the many obstacles facing women in her day to become a very prominent mathematician. Gauss died at the age of 78 in Göttingen on February 23, 1855.   "

  "body": " Sage   We have already seen some integral domains and unique factorizations in the previous two chapters. In addition to what we have already seen, Sage has support for some of the topics from this section, but the coverage is limited. Some functions will work for some rings and not others, while some functions are not yet part of Sage. So we will give some examples, but this is far from comprehensive.    Field of Fractions  Sage is frequently able to construct a field of fractions, or identify a certain field as the field of fractions. For example, the ring of integers and the field of rational numbers are both implemented in Sage, and the integers know that the rationals is it's field of fractions.    In other cases Sage will construct a fraction field, in the spirit of . So it is then possible to do basic calculations in the constructed field.       Prime Subfields   says every field of characteristic has a subfield isomorphic to . For a finite field, the exact nature of this subfield is not a surprise, but Sage will allow us to extract it easily.     More generally, the fields mentioned in the conclusions of and are known as the prime subfield of the ring containing them. Here is an example of the characteristic zero case.    In a rough sense, every characteristic zero field contains a copy of the rational numbers (the fraction field of the integers), which can explain Sage's extensive support for rings and fields that extend the integers and the rationals.    Integral Domains  Sage can determine if some rings are integral domains and we can test products in them. However, notions of units, irreducibles or prime elements are not generally supported (outside of what we have seen for polynomials in the previous chapter). Worse, the construction below creates a ring within a larger field and so some functions (such as .is_unit() ) pass through and give misleading results. This is because the construction below creates a ring known as an order in a number field.        The following is a bit misleading, since , as an element of does not have a multiplicative inverse, though seemingly we can compute one.      Principal Ideals  When a ring is a principal ideal domain, such as the integers, or polynomials over a field, Sage works well. Beyond that, support begins to weaken.        "

On many posets it is possible to define binary operations by using the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of two elements.

  "title": "The Algebra of Electrical Circuits",
  "body": " The Algebra of Electrical Circuits   The usefulness of Boolean algebras has become increasingly apparent over the past several decades with the development of the modern computer. The circuit design of computer chips can be expressed in terms of Boolean algebras. In this section we will develop the Boolean algebra of electrical circuits and switches; however, these results can easily be generalized to the design of integrated computer circuitry.  A switch Switch definition of is a device, located at some point in an electrical circuit, that controls the flow of current through the circuit. Each switch has two possible states: it can be Switch open open , and not allow the passage of current through the circuit, or a it can be Switch closed closed , and allow the passage of current. These states are mutually exclusive. We require that every switch be in one state or the other a switch cannot be open and closed at the same time. Also, if one switch is always in the same state as another, we will denote both by the same letter; that is, two switches that are both labeled with the same letter will always be open at the same time and closed at the same time.  Given two switches, we can construct two fundamental types of circuits. Two switches and are in series Circuit series if they make up a circuit of the type that is illustrated in . Current can pass between the terminals and in a series circuit only if both of the switches and are closed. We will denote this combination of switches by . Two switches and are in parallel Circuit parallel if they form a circuit of the type that appears in . In the case of a parallel circuit, current can pass between and if either one of the switches is closed. We denote a parallel combination of circuits and by .      A graph with a path from left to right that connect A, a, b, and B in that order.         A graph from left ot right that has two paths. Starting on the left A goes to a on the top path and a goes to B. The second path starts on the left at A and then goes to b on the bottom path and b goes to B.     We can build more complicated electrical circuits out of series and parallel circuits by replacing any switch in the circuit with one of these two fundamental types of circuits. Circuits constructed in this manner are called Circuit series-parallel series-parallel circuits .  We will consider two circuits equivalent if they act the same. That is, if we set the switches in equivalent circuits exactly the same we will obtain the same result. For example, in a series circuit is exactly the same as . Notice that this is exactly the commutative law for Boolean algebras. In fact, the set of all series-parallel circuits forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of and . We can use diagrams to verify the different axioms of a Boolean algebra. The distributive law, , is illustrated in . If is a switch, then is the switch that is always open when is closed and always closed when is open. A circuit that is always closed is in our algebra; a circuit that is always open is . The laws for and are shown in and , respectively.      Two graphs. The graph on the left has two paths. a goes to b on the top path and a goes to c on the bottom path, after which the two paths rejoin. The graph on the right also has two paths. A single path splits to two paths. On the top path a goes to b. On the bottom path a goes to c. Then the two paths rejoin.          In the graph, a is goes to to a'.         The graph splits into two paths. The top path is a and the bottom path is a' after which the paths rejoin.       Every Boolean expression represents a switching circuit. For example, given the expression , we can construct the circuit in .     The set of all circuits is a Boolean algebra.    We leave as an exercise the proof of this theorem for the Boolean algebra axioms not yet verified. We can now apply the techniques of Boolean algebras to switching theory.     Given a complex circuit, we can now apply the techniques of Boolean algebra to reduce it to a simpler one. Consider the circuit in . Since , we can replace the more complicated circuit with a circuit containing the single switch and achieve the same function.       A graph from left to right that splits into a top path a and bottom path b and then rejoins. The graph continues and splits into a top path a and a bottom path b', rejoins and splits into two paths, a and b, and finally rejoins.       Historical Note  George Boole Boole, George (1815 1864) was the first person to study lattices. In 1847, he published The Investigation of the Laws of Thought , a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic and the calculus of propositions. Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form rather than of content; that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating as with how he was calculating it. Boole's work was carried on by his friend Augustus De Morgan De Morgan, Augustus (1806 1871). De Morgan observed that the principle of duality often held in set theory, as is illustrated by De Morgan's laws for set theory. He believed, as did Boole, that mathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.  Set theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North Whitehead Whitehead, Alfred North (1861 1947), Bertrand Russell Russell, Bertrand (1872 1970), and David Hilbert Hilbert, David (1862 1943). In Principia Mathematica , Whitehead and Russell attempted to show the connection between mathematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal logic. If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself, then so could much of the rest of existing mathematics. Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using symbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics. His approach was dealt a mortal blow by Kurt Gödel Gödel, Kurt (1906 1978), who proved that there will always be undecidable problems in any sufficiently rich axiomatic system; that is, that in any mathematical system of any consequence, there will always be statements that can never be proven either true or false.  As often occurs, this basic research in pure mathematics later became indispensable in a wide variety of applications. Boolean algebras and logic have become essential in the design of the large-scale integrated circuitry found on today's computer chips. Sociologists have used lattices and Boolean algebras to model social hierarchies; biologists have used them to describe biosystems.   "

  "title": "Sage",
  "body": " Sage   Sage has support for both partially ordered sets ( posets ) and lattices, and does an excellent job of providing visual depictions of both.    Creating Partially Ordered Sets   in the text is a good example to replicate as a demonstration of Sage commands. We first define the elements of the set .   One approach to creating the relation is to specify every instance where one element is comparable to the another. So we build a list of pairs, where each pair contains comparable elements, with the lesser one first. This is the set of relations.   We construct the poset by giving the the Poset constructor a list containing the elements and the relations. We can then easily get a plot of the poset. Notice the plot just shows the cover relations  a minimal set of comparisons which the assumption of transitivity would expand into the set of all the relations.   Another approach to creating a Poset is to let the poset constructor run over all the pairs of elements, and all we do is give the constructor a way to test if two elements are comparable. Our comparison function should expect two elements and then return True or False . A lambda function is one way to quickly build such a function. This may be a new idea for you, but mastering lambda functions can be a great convenience. Notice that lambda is a word reserved for just this purpose (so, for example, lambda is a bad choice for the name of an eigenvalue of a matrix). There are other ways to make functions in Sage, but a lambda function is quickest when the function is simple.    Sage also has a collection of stock posets. Some are one-shot constructions, while others are members of parameterized families. Use tab-completion on Posets. to see the full list. Here are some examples.  A one-shot construction. Perhaps what you would expect, though there might be other, equally plausible, alternatives.   A parameterized family. This is the classic example where the elements are subsets of a set with elements and the relation is subset of.    And random posets. These can be useful for testing and experimenting, but are unlikely to exhibit special cases that may be important. You might run the following command many times and vary the second argument, which is a rough upper bound on the probability any two elements are comparable. Remember that the plot only shows the cover relations. The more elements that are comparable, the more vertically stretched the plot will be.     Properties of a Poset  Once you have a poset, what can you do with it? Let's return to our first example, D . We can of course determine if one element is less than another, which is the fundamental structure of a poset.        Notice that 6 and 8 are not comparable in this poset (it is a partial order). The methods .is_gequal() and .is_greater_than() work similarly, but returns True if the first element is greater (or equal).    We can find the largest and smallest elements of a poset. This is a random poset built with a 10%probability, but copied here to be repeatable.     Elements of a poset can be partioned into level sets. In plots of posets, elements at the same level are plotted vertically at the same height. Each level set is obtained by removing all of the previous level sets and then taking the minimal elements of the result.   If we make two elements in R comparable when they had not previously been, this is an extension of R . Consider all possible extensions of one poset we can make a poset from all of these, where set inclusion is the relation. A linear extension is a maximal element in this poset of posets. Informally, we are adding as many new relations as possible, consistent with the original poset and so that the result is a total order. In other words, there is an ordering of the elements that is consistent with the order in the poset. We can build such a thing, but the output is just a list of the elements in the linear order. A computer scientist would be inclined to call this a topological sort.    We can construct subposets by giving a set of elements to induce the new poset. Here we take roughly the bottom half of the random poset P by inducing the subposet on a union of some of the level sets.   The dual of a poset retains the same set of elements, but reverses any comparisons.   Taking the dual of the divisibility poset from would be like changing the relation to is a multiple of.      Lattices  Every lattice is a poset, so all the commands above will perform equally well for a lattice. But how do you create a lattice? Simple first create a poset and then feed it into the LatticePoset() constructor. But realize that just because you give this constructor a poset, it does not mean a lattice will always come back out. Only if the poset is already a lattice will it get upgraded from a poset to a lattice for Sage's purposes, and you will get a ValueError if the upgrade is not possible. Finally, notice that some of the posets Sage constructs are already recognized as lattices, such as the prototypical BooleanLattice .    An integer composition of is a list of positive integers that sum to . A composition covers a composition if can be formed from by adding consecutive parts. For example, . With this relation, the set of all integer compositions of a fixed integer is a poset that is also a lattice.   A meet or a join is a fundamental operation in a lattice.          Once a poset is upgraded to lattice status, then additional commands become available, or the character of their results changes.  An example of the former is the .is_distributive() method.   An example of the latter is the .top() method. What your text calls a largest element and a smallest element of a lattice, Sage calls a top and a bottom. For a poset, .top() and .bottom() may return an element or may not (returning None ), but for a lattice it is guaranteed to return exactly one element.    Notice that the returned values are all elements of the lattice, in this case ordered lists of integers summing to .  Complements now make sense in a lattice. The result of the .complements() method is a dictionary that uses elements of the lattice as the keys. We say the dictionary is indexed by the elements of the lattice. The result is a list of the complements of the element. We call this the value of the key-value pair. (You may know dictionaries as associative arrays , but they are really just fancy functions.)   The lattice of integer compositions is a complemented lattice, as we can see by the result that each element has a single (unique) complement, evidenced by the lists of length in the values of the dictionary. Or we can just ask Sage via .is_complemented() . Dictionaries have no inherent order, so you may get different output each time you inspect the dictionary.     There are many more commands which apply to posets and lattices, so build a few and use tab-completion liberally to explore. There is more to discover than we can cover in just a single chapter, but you now have the basic tools to profitably study posets and lattices in Sage.   "

  "body": " Sage   Many computations, in seemingly very different areas of mathematics, can be translated into questions about linear combinations, or other areas of linear algebra. So Sage has extensive and thorough support for topics such as vector spaces.    Vector Spaces  The simplest way to create a vector space is to begin with a field and use an exponent to indicate the number of entries in the vectors of the space.    Elements can be built with the vector constructor.      Notice that vectors are printed with parentheses, which helps distinguish them from lists (though they alos look like tuples). Vectors print horizontally, but in Sage there is no such thing as a row vector or a column vector, though once matrices get involved we need to address this distinction. Finally, notice how the elements of the finite field have been converted to an alternate representation.  Once we have vector spaces full of vectors, we can perform computations with them. Ultimately, all the action in a vector space comes back to vector addition and scalar multiplication, which together create linear combinations.      Subspaces  Sage can create subspaces in a variety of ways, such as in the creation of row or column spaces of matrices. However, the most direct way is to begin with a set of vectors to use as a spanning set.     Notice that the information printed about S includes a basis matrix. The rows of this matrix are a basis for the vector space. We can get the basis, as a list of vectors (not rows of a matrix), with the .basis() method.   Notice that Sage has converted the spanning set of three vectors into a basis with two vectors. This is partially due to the fact that the original set of three vectors is linearly dependent, but a more substantial change has occurred.  This is a good place to discuss some of the mathematics behind what makes Sage work. A vector space over an infinite field, like the rationals or the reals, is an infinite set. No matter how expansive computer memory may seem, it is still finite. How does Sage fit an infinite set into our finite machines? The main idea is that a finite-dimensional vector space has a finite set of generators, which we know as a basis. So Sage really only needs the elements of a basis (two vectors in the previous example) to be able to work with the infinitely many possibilities for elements of the subspace.  Furthermore, for every basis associated with a vector space, Sage performs linear combinations to convert the given basis into another standard basis. This new basis has the property that as the rows of a matrix, the matrix is in reduced row-echelon form. You can see this in the basis matrix above. The reduced row-echelon form of a matrix is unique, so this standard basis allows Sage to recognize when two vector spaces are equal. Here is an example.    As you might expect, it is easy to determine the dimension of a vector space.     Linear Independence  There are a variety of ways in Sage to determine if a set of vectors is linearly independent or not, and to find relations of linear dependence if they exist. The technique we will show here is a simple test to see if a set of vectors is linearly independent or not. Simply use the vectors as a spanning set for a subspace, and check the dimension of the subspace. The dimension equals the number of vectors in the spanning set if and only if the spanning set is linearly independent.    So the first set of vectors, [u, v, w] , is linearly independent, while the second set, [u, v, a^3*u + a^11*v] , is not.    Abstract Vector Spaces  Sage does not implement many abstract vector spaces directly, such as , the vector space of polynomials of degree or less. This is due in part to the fact that a finite-dimensional vector space over a field is isomorphic to the vector space . So Sage captures all the functionality of finite-dimensional vector spaces, and it is left to the user to perform the conversions according to the isomorphism (which is often trivial with the choice of an obvious basis).  However, there are instances where rings behave naturally as vector spaces and we can exploit this extra structure. We will see much more of this in the chapters on fields and Galois theory. As an example, finite fields have a single generator, and the first few powers of the generator form a basis. Consider creating a vector space from the elements of a finite field of order . As elements of a field we know they can be added, so we will define this to be the addition in our vector space. For any element of the integers mod 7, we can multiply an element of the field by the integer, so we define this to be our scalar multiplication. Later, we will be certain that these two definitions lead to a vector space, but take that for granted now. So here are some operations in our new vector space.     You might recognize that this looks very familiar to how we add polynomials, and multiply polynomials by scalars. You would be correct. However, notice that in this vector space construction, we are totally ignoring the possibility of multiplying two field elements together. As a vector space with scalars from , a basis is the first six powers of the generator, . (Notice how counting from zero is natural here.) You may have noticed how Sage consistently rewrites elements of fields as linear combinations now you have a good explanation.  Here is what Sage knows about a finite field as a vector space. First, it knows that the finite field is a vector space, and what the field of scalars is. We suppress additional output with isomorphisms between the finite field structure and the vector space structure.      So the finite field (as a vector space) is isomorphic to the vector space . Notice this is not a ring or field isomorphism, as it does not fully address multiplication of elements, even though that is possible in the field.  Second, elements of the field can be converted to elements of the vector space easily.    Notice that Sage writes field elements with high powers of the generator first, while the basis in use is ordered with low powers first. The computations below illustrate the isomorphism preserving the structure between the finite field itself and its interpretation as a vector space, .      Linear Algebra  Sage has extensive support for linear algebra, well beyond what we have described here, or what we will need for the remaining chapters. Create vector spaces and vectors (with different fields of scalars), and then use tab-completion on these objects to explore the large sets of available commands.   "

Compare their individual dimensions with the dimensions of the intersection of and ( , .intersection() in Sage) and the sum .  Repeat the experiment with the two original vector spaces having dimension or so, and with the intersection as small as possible. Form a general conjecture relating these four dimensions based on the results of your two (or more)experiments.    We can construct a field in Sage that extends the rationals by adding in a fourth root of two, , with the command F.<c> = QQ[2^(1\/4)] . This is a vector space of dimension over the rationals, with a basis that is the first four powers of (starting with the zero power).  The command F.vector_space() will return three items in a triple (so be careful how you handle this output to extract what you need). The first part of the output is a vector space over the rationals that is isomorphic to F . The next is a vector space isomorphism (invertible linear transformation) from the provided vector space to the field, while the third is an isomorphism in the opposite direction. These two isomorphisms can then be used like functions. Notice that this is different behavior than for .vector_space() applied to finite fields. Create non-trivial examples that show that these vector space isomorphisms behave as an isomorphism should. (You will have at least four such examples in a complete solution.)

You can build one easily with a construction like ZZ^3 . Evaluate the following to create a module and a submodule.

Almost all real numbers are transcendental over . The probability that a real number chosen at random from the interval will be transcendental over the rational numbers is one.

The process must eventually stop since the degree of is finite.  Conversely, suppose that every nonconstant polynomial in factors into linear factors. Let be such a factor. Then . Consequently, is algebraically closed.      An algebraically closed field has no proper algebraic extension .    Let be an algebraic extension of ; then . For , the minimal polynomial of is . Therefore, and .      Every field has a unique algebraic closure.    It is a nontrivial fact that every field has a unique algebraic closure. The proof is not extremely difficult, but requires some rather sophisticated set theory. We refer the reader to [3], [4], or [8] for a proof of this result.   We now state the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, first proven by Gauss at the age of 22 in his doctoral thesis. This theorem states that every polynomial with coefficients in the complex numbers has a root in the complex numbers. The proof of this theorem will be given in .   Fundamental Theorem of Algebra   Fundamental Theorem  of Algebra    The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed.     "

  "title": "Geometric Constructions",
  "body": " Geometric Constructions   In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed. These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry; that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them. The problems can be stated as follows.   Given an arbitrary angle, can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass?    Given an arbitrary circle, can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass?    Given a cube, can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original? Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction.   After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years, each of these constructions was finally shown to be impossible. We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist. It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.  First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass, and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth. To begin with, a straightedge is not a ruler . We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge. It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points. The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction. Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases. We can construct a angle; hence, it is possible to trisect a angle. However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a angle. Therefore, we cannot trisect a angle.    Constructible Numbers  A real number is constructible Constructible number if we can construct a line segment of length in a finite number of steps from a segment of unit length by using a straightedge and compass.    The set of all constructible real numbers forms a subfield of the field of real numbers.    Let and be constructible numbers. We must show that , , , and ( ) are also constructible numbers. We can assume that both and are positive with . It is quite obvious how to construct and . To find a line segment with length , we assume that and construct the triangle in such that triangles and are similar. Since , the line segment has length . A similar construction can be made if . We will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be used to construct for .     Construction of products    A triangle ADE with B on the line segment AD and C on the line segment AE such that BC is parallel to DE. The length of AB is 1, the length of AD is beta, the length of AC is alpha and the length of AE is x.       If is a constructible number, then is a constructible number.    In the triangles , , and are similar; hence, , or .     Construction of roots    A semi-circle with AC on the diameter and B on the arc of the circle. D is on eht line segment AC such that BD is perpendicular to AC. The length of AD is 1, the length of DC is alpha, and the length of BD is x. Triangles ABC, ADB, and BDC arre similar right triangle.     By , we can locate in the plane any point that has rational coordinates and . We need to know what other points can be constructed with a compass and straightedge from points with rational coordinates.    Let be a subfield of .   If a line contains two points in , then it has the equation , where , , and are in .    If a circle has a center at a point with coordinates in and a radius that is also in , then it has the equation , where , , and are in .       Let and be points on a line whose coordinates are in . If , then the equation of the line through the two points is , which has the form . If , then the equation of the line through the two points is given by , which can also be put into the proper form.  To prove the second part of the lemma, suppose that is the center of a circle of radius . Then the circle has the equation . This equation can easily be put into the appropriate form.    Starting with a field of constructible numbers , we have three possible ways of constructing additional points in with a compass and straightedge.   To find possible new points in , we can take the intersection of two lines, each of which passes through two known points with coordinates in .    The intersection of a line that passes through two points that have coordinates in and a circle whose center has coordinates in with radius of a length in will give new points in .    We can obtain new points in by intersecting two circles whose centers have coordinates in and whose radii are of lengths in .   The first case gives no new points in , since the solution of two equations of the form having coefficients in will always be in . The third case can be reduced to the second case. Let  be the equations of two circles, where , , and are in for . These circles have the same intersection as the circle and the line . The last equation is that of the chord passing through the intersection points of the two circles. Hence, the intersection of two circles can be reduced to the case of an intersection of a line with a circle.  Considering the case of the intersection of a line and a circle, we must determine the nature of the solutions of the equations . If we eliminate from these equations, we obtain an equation of the form , where , , and are in . The coordinate of the intersection points is given by and is in , where . We have proven the following lemma.    Let be a field of constructible numbers. Then the points determined by the intersections of lines and circles in lie in the field for some in .      A real number is a constructible number if and only if there exists a sequence of fields such that with and . In particular, there exists an integer such that .    The existence of the 's and the 's is a direct consequence of and of the fact that .       The field of all constructible numbers is an algebraic extension of .    As we can see by the field of constructible numbers, not every algebraic extension of a field is a finite extension.    Doubling the Cube and Squaring the Circle  We are now ready to investigate the classical problems of doubling the cube and squaring the circle. We can use the field of constructible numbers to show exactly when a particular geometric construction can be accomplished.   Doubling the cube is impossible   Doubling the cube   Given the edge of the cube, it is impossible to construct with a straightedge and compass the edge of the cube that has twice the volume of the original cube. Let the original cube have an edge of length and, therefore, a volume of . If we could construct a cube having a volume of , then this new cube would have an edge of length . However, is a zero of the irreducible polynomial over ; hence, This is impossible, since is not a power of .    Squaring the circle   Squaring the circle is impossible   Suppose that we have a circle of radius . The area of the circle is ; therefore, we must be able to construct a square with side . This is impossible since and consequently are both transcendental. Therefore, using a straightedge and compass, it is not possible to construct a square with the same area as the circle.     Trisecting an Angle   Trisection of an angle    Trisecting an arbitrary angle is impossible . We will show that it is impossible to construct a angle. Consequently, a angle cannot be trisected. We first need to calculate the triple-angle formula for the cosine: . The angle can be constructed if and only if is constructible. Let . Then . By the triple-angle formula for the cosine, . Therefore, is a zero of . This polynomial has no factors in , and hence is irreducible over . Thus, . Consequently, cannot be a constructible number.    Historical Note  Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory. Modern algebraic number theory began with Pierre de Fermat Fermat, Pierre de (1601 1665). Certainly we can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation ; Fermat conjectured that the equation has no positive integer solutions for . He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' Arithmetica that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem, but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it. Building on work of other mathematicians, it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s. Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the New York Times .  Attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler Euler, Leonhard (1707 1783). Significant advances in the understanding of Fermat's Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer Kummer, Ernst (1810 1893). Kummer's student, Leopold Kronecker Kronecker, Leopold (1823 1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth century. Kronecker's theory of ideals and his study of algebraic number theory added much to the understanding of fields.  David Hilbert Hilbert, David (1862 1943) and Hermann Minkowski Minkowski, Hermann (1864 1909) were among the mathematicians who led the way in this subject at the beginning of the twentieth century. Hilbert and Minkowski were both mathematicians at Göttingen University in Germany. Göttingen was truly one the most important centers of mathematical research during the last two centuries. The large number of exceptional mathematicians who studied there included Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, Noether, and Weyl.  André Weil Weil, André answered questions in number theory using algebraic geometry, a field of mathematics that studies geometry by studying commutative rings. From about 1955 to 1970, Alexander Grothendieck Grothendieck, Alexander dominated the field of algebraic geometry. Pierre Deligne, Deligne, Pierre a student of Grothendieck, solved several of Weil's number-theoretic conjectures. One of the most recent contributions to algebra and number theory is Gerd Faltings' Faltings, Gerd proof of the Mordell conjecture. Mordell conjecture This conjecture of Mordell, now known as Faltings' theorem, essentially says that certain polynomials in have only a finite number of integral solutions.   "

  "body": " Sage   In Sage, and other places, an extension of the rationals is called a number field. They are one of Sage's most mature features.    Number Fields  There are several ways to create a number field. We are familiar with the syntax where we adjoin an irrational number that we can write with traditional combinations of arithmetic and roots.   We can also specify the element we want to adjoin as the root of a monic irreducible polynomial. One approach is to construct the polynomial ring first so that the polynomial has the location of its coefficients specified properly.    Rather than building the whole polynomial ring, we can simply introduce a variable as the generator of a polynomial ring and then create polynomials from this variable. This spares us naming the polynomial ring. Notice in the example that both instances of z are necessary.    We can recover the polynomial used to create a number field, even if we constructed it by giving an expression for an irrational element. In this case, the polynomial is the minimal polynomial of the element.    For any element of a number field, Sage will obligingly compute its minimal polynomial.      Substituting element back into the alleged minimal polynomial and getting back zero is not convincing evidence that it is the minimal polynomial, but it is heartening.    Relative and Absolute Number Fields  With Sage we can adjoin several elements at once and we can build nested towers of number fields. Sage uses the term absolute to refer to a number field viewed as an extension of the rationals themselves, and the term relative to refer to a number field constructed, or viewed, as an extension of another (nontrivial) number field.      The number field A has been constructed mathematically as what we would write as . Notice the slight difference in ordering of the elements we are adjoining, and notice how the number fields use slightly fancier internal names ( sqrt2 , sqrt3 ) for the new elements.  We can flatten a relative field to view it as an absolute field, which may have been our intention from the start. Here we create a new number field from A that makes it a pure absolute number field.   Once we construct an absolute number field this way, we can recover isomorphisms to and from the absolute field. Recall that our tower was built with generators a and b , while the flattened tower is generated by c . The .structure() method returns a pair of functions, with the absolute number field as the domain and codomain (in that order).     This tells us that the single generator of the flattened tower, c , is equal to , and further, each of and can be expressed as polynomial functions of c . With these connections, you might want to compute the final two expressions in c by hand, and appreciate the work Sage does to determine these for us. This computation is an example of the conclusion of the upcoming .  Many number field methods have both relative and absolute versions, and we will also find it more convenient to work in a tower or a flattened version, thus the isomorphisms between the two can be invaluable for translating both questions and answers.  As a vector space over , or over another number field, number fields that are finite extensions have a dimension, called the degree. These are easy to get from Sage, though for a relative field, we need to be more precise about which degree we desire.       Splitting Fields  Here is a concrete example of how to use Sage to construct a splitting field of a polynomial. Consider . We first build a number field with a single root, and then factor the polynomial over this new, larger, field.        So our polynomial factors partially into two linear factors and a quadratic factor. But notice that the quadratic factor has a coefficient that is irrational, , so the quadratic factor properly belongs in the polynomial ring over M and not over QQ .  We build an extension containing a root of the quadratic factor, called q here. Then, rather than using the polygen() function, we build an entire polynomial ring R over N with the indeterminate z . The reason for doing this is we can illustrate how we upgrade the polynomial p with the syntax R(p) to go from having coefficients in M to having coefficients in N .      So we have a field, N , where our polynomial factors into linear factors with coefficients from the field. We can get another factorization by converting N to an absolute number field and factoring there. We need to recreate the polynomial over N , since a substitution will carry coefficients from the wrong ring.   This is an interesting alternative, in that the roots of the polynomial are expressions in terms of the single generator c . Since the roots involve a seventh power of c , we might suspect (but not be certain) that the minimal polynomial of c has degree and that P is a degree extension of the rationals. Indeed P (or N ) is a splitting field for . The roots are not really as bad as they appear lets convert them back to the relative number field.  First we want to rewrite a single factor (the first) in the form to identify the root with the correct signs.   With the conversion isomorphisms, we can recognize the roots for what they are.   So the rather complicated expression in c is just the negative of the root we adjoined in the second step of constructing the tower of number fields. It would be a good exercise to see what happens to the other three roots (being careful to get the signs right on each root).  This is a good opportunity to illustrate .        Algebraic Numbers   says that the set of all algebraic numbers forms a field. This field is implemented in Sage as QQbar . This allows for finding roots of polynomials as exact quantities which display as inexact numbers.   So we asked for the roots of a polynomial over the rationals, but requested any root that may lie outside the rationals and within the field of algebraic numbers. Since the field of algebraic numbers contains all such roots, we get a full four roots of the fourth-degree polynomial. These roots are computed to lie within an interval and the question mark indicates that the preceding digits are accurate. (The integers paired with each root are the multiplicities of that root. Use the keyword multiplicities=False to turn them off.) Let us take a look under the hood and see how Sage manages the field of algebraic numbers.    Three items are associated with this initial root. First is a number field, with generator a and a defining polynomial similar to the polynomial we are finding the roots of, but not identical. Second is an expression in the generator a , which is the actual root. You might evaluate this expression with the numerical approximation of a , coming next, to verify this is a root. Finally, there is a ring homomorphism from the number field to the Algebraic Real Field , AA , the subfield of QQbar with just real elements, which associates the generator a with the number -1.272019649514069? . Let us verify, in two ways, that the root given is really a root.    Now that we have enough theory to understand the field of algebraic numbers, and a natural way to represent them exactly, you might consider the operations in the field. If we take two algebraic numbers and add them together, we get another algebraic number ( ). So what is the resulting minimal polynomial? How is it computed in Sage? You could read the source code if you wanted the answer.    Geometric Constructions  Sage can do a lot of things, but it is not yet able to lay out lines with a straightedge and compass. However, we can very quickly determine that trisecting a degree angle is impossible. We adjoin the cosine of a degree angle (in radians) to the rationals, determine the degree of the extension, and check that it is not an integer power of . In one line. Sweet.    "

  "title": "Polynomial Codes",
  "body": " Polynomial Codes     With knowledge of polynomial rings and finite fields, it is now possible to derive more sophisticated codes than those of . First let us recall that an -block code consists of a one-to-one encoding function and a decoding function . The code is error-correcting if is onto. A code is a linear code if it is the null space of a matrix .  We are interested in a class of codes known as Code cyclic cyclic codes . Let be a binary -block code. Then is a cyclic code if for every codeword , the cyclically shifted -tuple is also a codeword. Cyclic codes are particularly easy to implement on a computer using shift registers [2, 3].   Consider the -linear codes generated by the two matrices . Messages in the first code are encoded as follows: It is easy to see that the codewords form a cyclic code. In the second code, 3-tuples are encoded in the following manner: This code cannot be cyclic, since is a codeword but is not a codeword.     Polynomial Codes  We would like to find an easy method of obtaining cyclic linear codes. To accomplish this, we can use our knowledge of finite fields and polynomial rings over . Any binary -tuple can be interpreted as a polynomial in . Stated another way, the -tuple corresponds to the polynomial , where the degree of is at most . For example, the polynomial corresponding to the -tuple is . Conversely, with any polynomial with we can associate a binary -tuple. The polynomial corresponds to the -tuple .  Let us fix a nonconstant polynomial in of degree . We can define an -code in the following manner. If is a -tuple to be encoded, then is the corresponding polynomial in . To encode , we multiply by . The codewords in are all those polynomials in of degree less than that are divisible by . Codes obtained in this manner are called Polynomial code Code polynomial polynomial codes .    If we let , we can define a -code as follows. To encode a -tuple , we multiply the corresponding polynomial by . We are defining a map by . It is easy to check that this map is a group homomorphism. In fact, if we regard as a vector space over , is a linear transformation of vector spaces (see , ). Let us compute the kernel of . Observe that exactly when . Since the polynomials over a field form an integral domain, must be the zero polynomial. Therefore, and is one-to-one.  To calculate a generator matrix for , we merely need to examine the way the polynomials , , and are encoded: . We obtain the code corresponding to the generator matrix in . The parity-check matrix for this code is . Since the smallest weight of any nonzero codeword is , this code has the ability to detect all single errors.   Rings of polynomials have a great deal of structure; therefore, our immediate goal is to establish a link between polynomial codes and ring theory. Recall that . The factor ring can be considered to be the ring of polynomials of the form that satisfy the condition . It is an easy exercise to show that and are isomorphic as vector spaces. We will often identify elements in with elements in . In this manner we can interpret a linear code as a subset of .  The additional ring structure on polynomial codes is very powerful in describing cyclic codes. A cyclic shift of an -tuple can be described by polynomial multiplication. If is a code polynomial in , then is the cyclically shifted word obtained from multiplying by . The following theorem gives a beautiful classification of cyclic codes in terms of the ideals of .    A linear code in is cyclic if and only if it is an ideal in .    Let be a linear cyclic code and suppose that is in . Then must also be in . Consequently, is in for all . Since is a linear code, any linear combination of the codewords is also a codeword; therefore, for every polynomial , is in . Hence, is an ideal.  Conversely, let be an ideal in . Suppose that is a codeword in . Then is a codeword in ; that is, is in .     tells us that knowing the ideals of is equivalent to knowing the linear cyclic codes in . Fortunately, the ideals in are easy to describe. The natural ring homomorphism defined by is a surjective homomorphism. The kernel of is the ideal generated by . By , every ideal in is of the form , where is an ideal in that contains . By , we know that every ideal in is a principal ideal, since is a field. Therefore, for some unique monic polynomial in . Since is contained in , it must be the case that divides . Consequently, every ideal in is of the form . The unique monic polynomial of the smallest degree that generates is called the minimal generator polynomial Minimal generator polynomial Polynomial minimal generator of .   If we factor into irreducible components, we have . We see that generates an ideal in . This code is a -block code. As in , it is easy to calculate a generator matrix by examining what does to the polynomials 1, , , and . A generator matrix for is .   In general, we can determine a generator matrix for an -code by the manner in which the elements are encoded. Let in . If and , then the matrix is a generator matrix for the code with generator polynomial . The parity-check matrix for is the matrix . We will leave the details of the proof of the following proposition as an exercise.    Let be a cyclic code in and suppose that . Then and are generator and parity-check matrices for , respectively. Furthermore, .     In , . Therefore, a parity-check matrix for this code is .   To determine the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities of a cyclic code, we need to know something about determinants. If are elements in a field , then the matrix is called the Vandermonde matrix Matrix, Vandermonde Vandermonde matrix . The determinant of this matrix is called the Vandermonde determinant Determinant, Vandermonde Vandermonde determinant . We will need the following lemma in our investigation of cyclic codes.    Let be elements in a field with . Then . In particular, if the 's are distinct, then the determinant is nonzero.    We will induct on . If , then the determinant is . Let us assume the result for and consider the polynomial defined by . Expanding this determinant by cofactors on the last column, we see that is a polynomial of at most degree . Moreover, the roots of are , since the substitution of any one of these elements in the last column will produce a column identical to the last column in the matrix. Remember that the determinant of a matrix is zero if it has two identical columns. Therefore, , where . By our induction hypothesis, . If we let , the result now follows immediately.    The following theorem gives us an estimate on the error detection and correction capabilities for a particular generator polynomial.    Let be a cyclic code in and suppose that is a primitive th root of unity over . If consecutive powers of are roots of , then the minimum distance of is at least .    Suppose that . Let be some polynomial in with or fewer nonzero coefficients. We can assume that be some polynomial in . It will suffice to show that all of the 's must be 0. Since and divides , . Equivalently, we have the following system of equations: . Therefore, is a solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations . However, this system has a unique solution, since the determinant of the matrix can be shown to be nonzero using and the basic properties of determinants (Exercise). Therefore, this solution must be .      BCH Codes  Some of the most important codes, discovered independently by A. Hocquenghem in 1959 and by R. C. Bose and D. V. Ray-Chaudhuri in 1960, are BCH codes. The European and transatlantic communication systems both use BCH codes. Information words to be encoded are of length , and a polynomial of degree is used to generate the code. Since , we are dealing with a -block code. This BCH code will detect six errors and has a failure rate of in million. One advantage of BCH codes is that efficient error correction algorithms exist for them.  The idea behind BCH codes is to choose a generator polynomial of smallest degree that has the largest error detection and error correction capabilities. Let for some . Suppose that is a primitive th root of unity over , and let be the minimal polynomial over of . If , then the cyclic code in is called the BCH code of length Code BCH   and distance  . By , the minimum distance of is at least .    Let be a cyclic code in . The following statements are equivalent.   The code is a BCH code whose minimum distance is at least .    A code polynomial is in if and only if for .    The matrix is a parity-check matrix for .       (1) (2). If is in , then in . Hence, for , since . Conversely, suppose that for . Then is divisible by each , since is the minimal polynomial of . Therefore, by the definition of . Consequently, is a codeword.  (2) (3). Let be in . The corresponding -tuple in is . By (2), exactly when is in . Thus, is a parity-check matrix for .  (3) (1). By (3), a code polynomial is in exactly when for . The smallest such polynomial is . Therefore, .     It is easy to verify that has a factorization , where each of the factors is an irreducible polynomial. Let be a root of . The Galois field is . By , is a primitive th root of unity. The minimal polynomial of is . It is easy to see that and are also roots of . The minimal polynomial of is . Therefore, has roots , , , . Since both and divide , the BCH code is a -code. If , then ; therefore, a parity-check matrix for this code is .    "

  "body": " Sage   You have noticed in this chapter that finite fields have a great deal of structure. We have also seen finite fields in Sage regularly as examples of rings and fields. Now we can combine the two, mostly using commands we already know, plus a few new ones.    Creating Finite Fields  By we know that all finite fields of a given order are isomorphic and that possible orders are limited to powers of primes. We can use the FiniteField() command, as before, or a shorter equivalent is GF() . Optionally, we can specify an irreducible polynomial for the contruction of the field. We can view this polynomial as the generator of the principal ideal of a polynomial ring, or we can view it as a re-writing rule for powers of the field's generator that allow us to multiply elements and reformulate them as linear combinations of lesser powers.  Absent providing an irreducible polynomial, Sage will use a Conway polynomial. You can determine these with the conway_polynomial() command, or just build a finite field and request the defining polynomial with the .polynomial() method.      Just to be more readable, we coerce a list of coefficients into the set of polynomials (obtained with the .parent() method on a simple polynomial) to define a polynomial.       Logarithms in Finite Fields  One useful command we have not described is the .log() method for elements of a finite field. Since we now know that the multiplicative group of nonzero elements is cyclic, we can express every element as a power of the generator. The log method will return that power.  Usually we will want to use the generator as the base of a lograithm computation in a finite field. However, other bases may be used, wih the understanding that if the base is not a generator, then the logarithm may not exist ( there may not be a solution to the relevant equation).       Since we already know many Sage commands, there is not much else worth introducing before we can work profitably with finite fields. The exercises explore the ways we can examine and exploit the structure of finite fields in Sage.   "

Comment on what is interesting about this result and why it is not a surprise.     says that the nonzero elements of a finite field are a cyclic group under multiplication. The generator used in Sage is also a generator of this multiplicative group. To see this, create a finite field of order . Create two lists of the elements of the field: first, use the .list() method, then use a list comprehension to generate the proper powers of the generator you specified when you created the field.  The second list should be the whole field, but will be missing zero. Create the zero element of the field (perhaps by coercing into the field) and .append() it to the list of powers. Apply the sorted() command to each list and then test the lists for equality.    Subfields of a finite field are completely classified by . It is possible to create two finite fields of the correct orders for the superfield\/subfield relationship to hold, and to translate between one and the other. However, in this exercise we will create a subfield of a finite field from scratch. Since the group of nonzero elements in a finite field is cyclic, the nonzero elements of a subfield will form a subgroup of the cyclic group, and necessarily will be cyclic.  Create a finite field of order . Theory says there is a subfield of order , since . Determine a generator of multiplicative order for the nonzero elements of this subfield, and construct these elements. Add in the field's zero element to this list. It should be clear that this set of elements is closed under multiplication. Absent our theorems about finite fields and cyclic groups, the closure under addition is not a given. Write a single statement that checks if this set is also closed under addition, by considering all possible sums of elements from the set.    This problem investigates the separableness of . You can create this number field quickly with the NumberFieldTower constructor, along with the polynomials and . Flatten the tower with the .absolute_field() method and use the .structure() method to retrieve mappings between the tower and the flattened version. Name the tower N and use a and b as generators. Name the flattened version L with c as a generator.  Create a nontrivial ( random ) element of L using as many powers of c as possible (check the degree of L to see how many linearly independent powers there are). Request from Sage the minimum polynomial of your random element, thus ensuring the element is a root. Construct the minimum polynomial as a polynomial over N , the field tower, and find its factorization. Your factorization should have only linear factors. Each root should be an expression in a and b , so convert each root into an expression with mathematical notation involving and . Use one of the mappings to verify that one of the roots is indeed the original random element.  Create a few more random elements, and find a factorization (in N or in L ). For a field to be separable, every element of the field should be a root of some separable polynomial. The minimal polynomial is a good polynomial to test. (Why?) Based on the evidence, does it appear that is a separable extension?     describes the Frobenius Map, an automorphism of a finite field. If F is a finite field in Sage, then End(F) will create the automorphism group of F, the set of all bijective mappings between the field and itself.    Work to gain an understanding of how and why the Frobenius mapping is a field automorphism. (Do not include any of this in your answer to this question, but understand that the following will be much easier if you do this problem first.)    For some small, but not trivial, finite fields locate the Frobenius map in the automorphism group. Small might mean and , with prime versus composite.    Once you have located the Frobenius map, describe the other automorphisms. In other words, with a bit of investigation, you should find a description of the automorphisms which will allow you to accurately predict the entire automorphism group for a finite field you have not already explored. (Hint: the automorphism group is a group. What if you do the operation between the Frobenius map and itself? Just what is the operation? Try using Sage's multiplicative notation with the elements of the automorphism group.)    What is the structure of the automorphism group? What special status does the Frobenius map have in this group?    For any field, the subfield known as the fixed field is an important construction, and will be especially important in the next chapter. Given an automorphism of a field , the subset, , can be shown to be a subfield of . It is known as the fixed field of in . For each automorphism of identify the fixed field of the automorphism. Since we understand the structure of subfields of a finite field, it is enough to just determine the order of the fixed field to be able to identify the subfield precisely.       suggests that every element of a finite field may be written (expressed) as a sum of squares. This exercise suggests computational experiments which might help you formulate a proof for the exercise.    Construct two small, but not too small, finite fields, one with and the other with an odd prime. Repeat the following for each field, .    Choose a random element of the field, say . Construct the sets using Sage sets with the constructor. (Be careful: set() is a Python command which behaves differently in fundamental ways.)    Examine the size of the two sets and the size of their intersection ( .intersection() ). Try different elements for , perhaps writing a loop to try all possible values. Note that will behave quite differently.    Suppose you have an element of the intersection. (You can get one with .an_element() .) How does this lead to the sum of squares proposed in the exercise?    Can you write a Python function that accepts a finite field whose order is a power of an odd prime and then lists each element as a sum of squares?     "

If F is a finite field in Sage, then End(F) will create the automorphism group of F, the set of all bijective mappings between the field and itself.    Work to gain an understanding of how and why the Frobenius mapping is a field automorphism. (Do not include any of this in your answer to this question, but understand that the following will be much easier if you do this problem first.)    For some small, but not trivial, finite fields locate the Frobenius map in the automorphism group. Small might mean and , with prime versus composite.    Once you have located the Frobenius map, describe the other automorphisms. In other words, with a bit of investigation, you should find a description of the automorphisms which will allow you to accurately predict the entire automorphism group for a finite field you have not already explored. (Hint: the automorphism group is a group. What if you do the operation between the Frobenius map and itself? Just what is the operation? Try using Sage's multiplicative notation with the elements of the automorphism group.)    What is the structure of the automorphism group? What special status does the Frobenius map have in this group?    For any field, the subfield known as the fixed field is an important construction, and will be especially important in the next chapter. Given an automorphism of a field , the subset, , can be shown to be a subfield of . It is known as the fixed field of in . For each automorphism of identify the fixed field of the automorphism. Since we understand the structure of subfields of a finite field, it is enough to just determine the order of the fixed field to be able to identify the subfield precisely.    "

Separable Extensions  Many of the results that we have just proven depend on the fact that a polynomial in has no repeated roots in its splitting field. It is evident that we need to know exactly when a polynomial factors into distinct linear factors in its splitting field. Let be the splitting field of a polynomial in . Suppose that factors over as . We define the multiplicity Multiplicity of a root Zero multiplicity of of a root of to be . A root with multiplicity 1 is called a Simple root simple root .

Certainly extensions of a field of the form are some of the easiest to study and understand. Given a field extension of , the obvious question to ask is when it is possible to find an element such that . In this case, is called a Element primitive Primitive element primitive element .

The very clever proof of the following lemma is due to Artin.    Let be a finite group of automorphisms of and let . Then .    Let . We must show that any set of elements in is linearly dependent over ; that is, we need to find elements , not all zero, such that . Suppose that are the automorphisms in . The homogeneous system of linear equations has more unknowns than equations. From linear algebra we know that this system has a nontrivial solution, say for . Since is the identity, the first equation translates to . The problem is that some of the 's may be in but not in . We must show that this is impossible.   Suppose that at least one of the 's is in but not in . By rearranging the 's we may assume that is nonzero. Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution, we can also assume that . Of all possible solutions fitting this description, we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms. Again, by rearranging if necessary, we can assume that is in but not in . Since is the subfield of that is fixed elementwise by , there exists a in such that . Applying to each equation in the system, we end up with the same homogeneous system, since is a group. Therefore, , , , is also a solution of the original system. We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution; consequently, must be another solution of the system. This is a nontrivial solution because , and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution. This is a contradiction, since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal. We can therefore conclude that .    Let be an algebraic extension of . If every irreducible polynomial in with a root in has all of its roots in , then is called a normal extension Extension normal Normal extension of ; that is, every irreducible polynomial in containing a root in is the product of linear factors in .

In we examined the automorphisms of fixing . compares the lattice of field extensions of with the lattice of subgroups of . The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory tells us what the relationship is between the two lattices.        The graph is a lattice of subgroups of the group (identity, sigma, tau, mu). The group (identity, sigma, tau, mu) has subgroups (identity, sigma), (identity, tau), and (identity, mu). At level three there is the subgroup (identity), which is contained in all subgroups.     The graph is a lattice of subfields of the rationals with the square root of three and the square root of five attached. The field of the rationals with the square root of three and the square root of five attached, has subfields of the rationals with the square root of three attached, the rationals with the square root of five attached, and the rationals with the square root of fifteen attached. At level three there are the rationals which are contained in all of the fields above.      We are now ready to state and prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.   Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory   Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory    Let be a finite field or a field of characteristic zero.

At level four there is the rationals which is a subfield of all of the other fields. In bottom lattice, there is the dihedral group, D4, at the top level. The next level consists of three subgroups: (identity, sigma squared, tau, sigma squared times tau), (identity, sigma, sigma squared, sigma cubed), and (identity, sigma squared, sigma times tau, sigma cubed times tau). The third level consists of five subgroups. (identity, tau) is a subgroup of (identity, sigma squared, tau, sigma squared times tau). (identity, sigma squared times tau) is a subgroup of (identity, sigma squared, tau, sigma squared times tau). (identity, sigma squared) is a subgroup of (identity, sigma squared, tau, sigma squared times tau), (identity, sigma, sigma squared, sigma cubed), and (identity, sigma squared, sigma times tau, sigma cubed times tau). (identity, sigma times tau) is a subgroup of (identity, sigma squared, sigma times tau, sigma cubed times tau). (identity, sigma cubed times tau) is a subgroup of (identity, sigma squared, sigma times tau, sigma cubed times tau). The bottom level has only the subgroup consisting of the identity, which is contained in all the subgroups.       Historical Note  Solutions for the cubic and quartic equations were discovered in the 1500s. Attempts to find solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of history's best mathematicians. In 1798, P. Ruffini Ruffini, P. submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found; however, the paper was not well received. In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel Abel, Niels Henrik (1802 1829) finally offered the first correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.  Abel inspired the work of Évariste Galois. Galois, Évariste Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraordinary mathematical talent at the age of 14. He applied for entrance to the École Polytechnique several times; however, he had great difficulty meeting the formal entrance requirements, and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical genius. He was finally accepted at the École Normale in 1829.  Galois worked to develop a theory of solvability for polynomials. In 1829, at the age of 17, Galois presented two papers on the solution of algebraic equations to the Académie des Sciences de Paris. These papers were sent to Cauchy, who subsequently lost them. A third paper was submitted to Fourier, who died before he could read the paper. Another paper was presented, but was not published until 1846.  Galois' democratic sympathies led him into the Revolution of 1830. He was expelled from school and sent to prison for his part in the turmoil. After his release in 1832, he was drawn into a duel possibly over a love affair. Certain that he would be killed, he spent the evening before his death outlining his work and his basic ideas for research in a long letter to his friend Chevalier. He was indeed dead the next day, at the age of 20.    "

  "body": " Applications   Solvability by Radicals    Throughout this section we shall assume that all fields have characteristic zero to ensure that irreducible polynomials do not have multiple roots. The immediate goal of this section is to determine when the roots of a polynomial can be computed with a finite number of operations on the coefficients of . The allowable operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of th roots. Certainly the solution to the quadratic equation, , illustrates this process: . The only one of these operations that might demand a larger field is the taking of th roots. We are led to the following definition.  An extension field of a field is an extension by radicals Extension radical if there exists a chain of subfields such for , we have and for some positive integer . A polynomial is solvable by radicals Solvability by radicals over if the splitting field of over is contained in an extension of by radicals. Our goal is to arrive at criteria that will tell us whether or not a polynomial is solvable by radicals by examining the Galois group .  The easiest polynomial to solve by radicals is one of the form . As we discussed in , the roots of are called the th root of unity nth roots of unity . These roots are a finite subgroup of the splitting field of . By , the th roots of unity form a cyclic group. Any generator of this group is called a Primitive th root of unity primitive nth root of unity .   The polynomial is solvable by radicals over . The roots of this polynomial are , where . The splitting field of over is .   We shall prove that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if its Galois group is solvable. Recall that a subnormal series of a group is a finite sequence of subgroups , where is normal in . A group is solvable if it has a subnormal series such that all of the factor groups are abelian. For example, if we examine the series , we see that is solvable. On the other hand, is not solvable, by .      Let be a field of characteristic zero and be the splitting field of over with . Then is a solvable group.    The roots of are , where is a primitive th root of unity. Suppose that contains all of its th roots of unity. If is one of the roots of , then distinct roots of are , and . Since permutes the roots , the elements in must be determined by their action on these roots. Let and be in and suppose that and . If contains the roots of unity, then . Therefore, and is abelian, and must be solvable.    Now suppose that does not contain a primitive th root of unity. Let be a generator of the cyclic group of the th roots of unity. Let be a zero of . Since and are both in the splitting field of , is also in . Let . Then . Since is the splitting field of , is a normal extension of . Therefore, any automorphism in is determined by . It must be the case that for some integer since all of the zeros of are powers of . If is in , then . Therefore, is abelian. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory the series is a normal series. By our previous argument, is abelian. Since is also abelian, is solvable.      Let be a field of characteristic zero and let a radical extension of . Then there exists a normal radical extension such that that contains and is a normal extension of .        Since is a radical extension of , there exists a chain of subfields such for , we have and for some positive integer . We will build a normal radical extension of , such that . Define for be the splitting field of . The roots of this polynomial are , where is a primitive th root of unity. If contains all of its roots of unity, then . On the other hand, suppose that does not contain a primitive th root of unity. If is a root of , then all of the roots of must be , where is a primitive th root of unity. In this case, . Thus, is a normal radical extension of containing . Continuing in this manner, we obtain such that is a normal extension of and for .    We will now prove the main theorem about solvability by radicals.    Let be in , where . If is solvable by radicals, then the Galois group of over is solvable.    Since is solvable by radicals there exists an extension of by radicals . By , we can assume that is a splitting field and is normal over . By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, is a normal subgroup of . Therefore, we have a subnormal series of subgroups of : . Again by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, we know that . By , is solvable; hence, is also solvable.    The converse of is also true. For a proof, see any of the references at the end of this chapter.    Insolvability of the Quintic  We are now in a position to find a fifth-degree polynomial that is not solvable by radicals. We merely need to find a polynomial whose Galois group is . We begin by proving a lemma.     If is prime, then any subgroup of that contains a transposition and a cycle of length must be all of .    Let be a subgroup of that contains a transposition and a cycle of length . We may assume that . The order of is and must be a cycle of length for . Therefore, we may assume that for some , where (see in ). Noting that and , we can obtain all the transpositions of the form for . However, these transpositions generate all transpositions in , since . The transpositions generate .     The graph of   The graph is one a set of rectangular axes and starts below the horizontal axis, increases to about 68 at x approximately equal to 2, while passing through the horizontal axis at about minus 3. The graph then decreases to about minus 73 at x equal to about 2.3, while passing through the horizontal axis at about minus 0.2. Finally, the graph increases to 20 at about 3.2, while passing through the horizontal axis at about 3.       We will show that is not solvable. We claim that the Galois group of over is . By Eisenstein's Criterion, is irreducible and, therefore, must be separable. The derivative of is ; hence, setting and solving, we find that the only real roots of are . Therefore, can have at most one maximum and one minimum. It is easy to show that changes sign between and , between and , and once again between and ( ). Therefore, has exactly three distinct real roots. The remaining two roots of must be complex conjugates. Let be the splitting field of . Since has five distinct roots in and every automorphism of fixing is determined by the way it permutes the roots of , we know that is a subgroup of . Since is irreducible, there is an element in such that for two roots and of . The automorphism of that takes leaves the real roots fixed and interchanges the complex roots; consequently, contains a transposition. If is one of the real roots of , then by . Since is a subfield of , it must be the case that is divisible by 5. Since and , we know that contains a cycle of length . By , is generated by a transposition and an element of order ; therefore, must be all of . By , is not solvable. Consequently, cannot be solved by radicals.      The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra  It seems fitting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis. Prior to Gauss's proof, mathematicians suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real and complex numbers having no solutions. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.   Fundamental Theorem of Algebra   Fundamental Theorem  of Algebra    The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed; that is, every polynomial in has a root in .     Suppose that is a proper finite field extension of the complex numbers. Since any finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension, there exists an such that with the root of an irreducible polynomial in . The splitting field of is a finite normal separable extension of that contains . We must show that it is impossible for to be a proper extension of .  Suppose that is a proper extension of . Since is the splitting field of over , is a finite normal separable extension of . Let be the fixed field of a Sylow 2-subgroup of . Then and . Since , we know that must be odd. Consequently, with having a minimal polynomial of odd degree. Therefore, .  We now know that must be a 2-group. It follows that is a -group. We have assumed that ; therefore, . By the first Sylow Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there exists a subgroup of of index 2 and a field fixed elementwise by . Then and there exists an element with minimal polynomial in . This polynomial has roots that are in , since is in . This is impossible; hence, .    Although our proof was strictly algebraic, we were forced to rely on results from calculus. It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every polynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root. It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this difficulty and formulate a purely algebraic argument. It is somewhat amazing that there are several elegant proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that use complex analysis. It is also interesting to note that we can obtain a proof of such an important theorem from two very different fields of mathematics.   "

  "body": " Sage   Again, our competence at examining fields with Sage will allow us to study the main concepts of Galois Theory easily. We will thoroughly examine Example 7 carefully using our computational tools.    Galois Groups  We will repeat and analyze carefully the splitting field of the polynomial . We begin with an initial field extension containing at least one root.   The .galois_closure() method will create an extension containing all of the roots of the defining polynomial of a number field.     From the factorization, it is clear that L is the splitting field of the polynomial, even if the factorization is not pretty. It is easy to then obtain the Galois group of this field extension.   We can examine this group, and identify it. Notice that since the field is a degree extension, the group is described as a permutation group on symbols. (It is just a coincidence that the group has elements.) With a paucity of nonabelian groups of order , it is not hard to guess the nature of the group.      That's it. But maybe not very satisfying. Let us dig deeper for more understanding. We will start over and create the splitting field of again, but the primary difference is that we will make the roots extremely obvious so we can work more carefully with the Galois group and the fixed fields. Along the way, we will see another example of linear algebra enabling certain computations. The following construction should be familiar by now.      The important thing to notice here is that we have arranged the splitting field so that the four roots, a, -a, b, -b , are very simple functions of the generators. In more traditional notation, a is , and b is (or their negatives).  We will find it easier to compute in the flattened tower, a now familiar construction.    We can return to our original polynomial (over the rationals), and ask for its roots in the flattened tower, custom-designed to contain these roots.   Hmmm. Do those look right? If you look back at the factorization obtained in the field constructed with the .galois_closure() method, then they look right. But we can do better.   Yes, those are the roots.  The End() command will create the group of automorphisms of the field L .   We can check that each of these automorphisms fixes the rational numbers elementwise. If a field homomorphism fixes 1, then it will fix the integers, and thus fix all fractions of integers.   So each element of G fixes the rationals elementwise and thus G is the Galois group of the splitting field L over the rationals.   is fundamental. It says every automorphism in the Galois group of a field extension creates a permutation of the roots of a polynomial with coefficients in the base field. We have all of those ingredients here. So we will evaluate each automorphism of the Galois group at each of the four roots of our polynomial, which in each case should be another root. (We use the Sequence() constructor just to get nicely-aligned output.)   Each row of the output is a list of the roots, but permuted, and so corresponds to a permutation of four objects (the roots). For example, the second row shows the second automorphism interchanging a with -a , and b with -b . (Notice that the first row is the result of the identity automorphism, so we can mentally comine the first row with any other row to imagine a two-row form of a permutation.) We can number the roots, 1 through 4, and create each permutation as an element of . It is overkill, but we can then build the permutation group by letting all of these elements generate a group.    Notice that we now have built an isomorphism from the Galois group to a group of permutations using just four symbols , rather than the eight used previously.    Fixed Fields  In a previous Sage exercise, we computed the fixed fields of single field automorphisms for finite fields. This was easy in the sense that we could just test every element of the field to see if it was fixed, since the field was finite. Now we have an infinite field extension. How are we going to determine which elements are fixed by individual automorphisms, or subgroups of automorphisms?  The answer is to use the vector space structure of the flattened tower. As a degree extension of the rationals, the first powers of the primitive element c form a basis when the field is viewed as a vector space with the rationals as the scalars. It is sufficient to know how each field automorphism behaves on this basis to fully specify the definition of the automorphism. To wit, So we can compute the value of a field automorphism at any linear combination of powers of the primitive element as a linear combination of the values of the field automorphism at just the powers of the primitive element. This is known as the power basis , which we can obtain simply with the .power_basis() method. We will begin with an example of how we can use this basis. We will illustrate with the fourth automorphism of the Galois group. Notice that the .vector() method is a convenience that strips a linear combination of the powers of c into a vector of just the coefficients. (Notice too that is totally defined by the value of , since as a field automorphism . However, we still need to work with the entire power basis to exploit the vector space structure.)        The last line expresses the fact that tau_matrix is a matrix representation of the field automorphism, viewed as a linear transformation of the vector space structure. As a representation of an invertible field homomorphism, the matrix is invertible. As an order permutation of the roots, the inverse of the matrix is itself. But these facts are just verifications that we have the right thing, we are interested in other properties.  To construct fixed fields, we want to find elements fixed by automorphisms. Continuing with tau from above, we seek elements z (written as vectors) such that tau_matrix*z=z . These are eigenvectors for the eigenvalue , or elements of the null space of (tau_matrix - I) (null spaces are obtained with .right_kernel() in Sage).   Each row of the basis matrix is a vector representing an element of the field, specifically 1 , c + (1\/38)*c^5 , c^2 - (1\/22)*c^6 , c^3 + (1\/278)*c^7 . Let's take a closer look at these fixed elements, in terms we recognize.      Any element fixed by tau will be a linear combination of these four elements. We can ignore any rational multiples present, the first element is just saying the rationals are fixed, and the last element is just a product of the middle two. So fundamentally tau is fixing rationals, b (which is ) and a^2 (which is ). Furthermore, b^2 = -a^2 (the check follows), so we can create any fixed element of tau by just adjoining b = to the rationals. So the elements fixed by tau are .     Galois Correspondence  The entire subfield structure of our splitting field is determined by the subgroup structure of the Galois group ( ), which is isomorphic to a group we know well. What are the subgroups of our Galois group, expressed as permutation groups? (For brevity, we just list the generators of each subgroup.)     tau above is the fourth element of the automorphism group, and the fourth permutation in elements is the permutation (2,3) , the generator (of order 2) for the second subgroup. So as the only nontrivial element of this subgroup, we know that the corresponding fixed field is .  Let us analyze another subgroup of order 2, without all the explanation, and starting with the subgroup. The sixth subgroup is generated by the fifth automorphism, so let us determine the elements that are fixed.       The first element indicates that the rationals are fixed (we knew that). Scaling the second element gives b - a as a fixed element. Scaling the third and fourth fixed elements, we recognize that they can be obtained from powers of b - a .    So the fixed field of this subgroup can be formed by adjoining b - a to the rationals, which in mathematical notation is , so the fixed field is .  We can create this fixed field, though as created here it is not strictly a subfield of L . We will use an expression for b - a that is a linear combination of powers of c .   The .subfield() method returns a pair. The first item is a new number field, isomorphic to a subfield of L . The second item is an injective mapping from the new number field into L . In this case, the image of the primitive element c0 is the element we have specified as the generator of the subfield. The primitive element of the new field will satisfy the defining polynomial  you can check that is indeed a root of the polynomial .  There are five subgroups of order , we have found fixed fields for two of them. The other three are similar, so it would be a good exercise to work through them. Our automorphism group has three subgroups of order 4, and at least one of each possible type (cyclic versus non-cyclic). Fixed fields of larger subgroups require that we find elements fixed by all of the automorphisms in the subgroup. (We were conveniently ignoring the identity automorphism above.) This will require more computation, but will restrict the possibilities (smaller fields) to where it will be easier to deduce a primitive element for each field.  The seventh subgroup is generated by two elements of order and is composed entirely of elements of order (except the identity), so is isomorphic to . The permutations correspond to automorphisms number 0, 1, 3, and 6. To determine the elements fixed by all four automorphisms, we will build the kernel for each one and as we go, we form the intersection of all four kernels. We will work via a loop over the four automorphisms.   Outside of the rationals, there is a single fixed element.   Removing a scalar multiple, our primitive element is a^2 , which mathematically is , so the fixed field is . Again, we can build this fixed field, but ignore the mapping.   One more subgroup. The penultimate subgroup has a permutation of order 4 as a generator, so is a cyclic group of order 4. The individual permutations of the subgroup correspond to automorphisms 0, 1, 2, 7.   So we compute the primitive element.   Since rationals are fixed, we can remove the and the multiple and take a^3*b as the primitive element. Mathematically, this is , so we might as well use just as the primitive element and the fixed field is . We can then build the fixed field (and ignore the mapping also returned).   There is one more subgroup of order , which we will leave as an exercise to analyze. There are also two trivial subgroups (the identity and the full group) which are not very interesting or surprising.  If the above seems like too much work, you can always just have Sage do it all with the .subfields() method.   Ten subfields are described, which is what we would expect, given the 10 subgroups of the Galois group. Each begins with a new number field that is a subfield. Technically, each is not a subset of L , but the second item returned for each subfield is an injective homomorphism, also known generally as an embedding. Each embedding describes how a primitive element of the subfield translates to an element of L . Some of these primitive elements could be manipulated (as we have done above) to yield slightly simpler minimal polynomials, but the results are quite impressive nonetheless. Each item in the list has a third component, which is almost always None , except when the subfield is the whole field, and then the third component is an injective homomorphism in the other direction.     Normal Extensions  Consider the third subgroup in the list above, generated by the permutation (1,4) . As a subgroup of order , it only has one nontrivial element, which here corresponds to the seventh automorphism. We determine the fixed elements as before.       As usual, ignoring rational multiples, we see powers of a and recognize that a alone will be a primitive element for the fixed field, which is thus . Recognize that a was our first root of , and was used to create the first part of original tower, N . So N is both and the fixed field of .   contains at least one root of the irreducible , but not all of the roots (witness the factorization above) and therefore does not qualify as a normal extension. By part (4) of the automorphism group of the extension is not normal in the full Galois group.   As expected.   "

Because is not solvable, we know this polynomial to be an example of a quintic polynomial that is not solvable by radicals. Unfortunately, asking Sage to compute this Galois group takes far too long. So this exercise will simulate that experience with a slightly smaller example.  Consider the polynomial .    Build the splitting field of one root at a time. Create an extension, factor there, discard linear factors, use the remaining irreducible factor to extend once more. Repeat until factors completely. Be sure to do a final extension via just a linear factor. This is a little silly, and Sage will seem to ignore your final generator (so you will want to setermine what it is equivalent to in terms of the previous gfenerators). Directions below depend on taking this extra step.    Factor the original polynomial over the final extension field in the tower. What is boring about this factorization in comparison to some other examples we have done?    Construct the full tower as an absolute field over . From the degree of this extension and the degree of the original polynomial, infer the Galois group of the polynomial.    Using the mappings that allow you to translate between the tower and the absolute field (obtained from the .structure() method), choose one of the roots (any one) and express it in terms of the single generator of the absolute field. Then reverse the procedure and express the single generator of the absolute field in terms of the roots in the tower.    Compute the group of automorphisms of the absolute field (but don't display the whole group in what you submit). Take all four roots (including your silly one from the last step of the tower construction) and apply each field automorphism to the four roots (creating the guaranteed permutations of the roots). Comment on what you see.    There is one nontrivial automorphism that has an especially simple form (it is the second one for me) when applied to the generator of the absolute field. What does this automorphism do to the roots of ?    Consider the extension of formed by adjoining just one of the roots. This is a subfield of the splitting field of the polynomial, so is the fixed field of a subgroup of the Galois group. Give a simple description of the corresponding subgroup using language we typically only apply to permutation groups.      Return to the splitting field of the quintic discussed in the introduction to the previous problem ( ). Create the first two intermediate fields by adjoining two roots (one at a time). But instead of factoring at each step to get a new irreducible polynomial, divide by the linear factor you know is a factor. In general, the quotient might factor further, but in this exercise presume it does not. In other words, act as if your quotient by the linear factor is irreducible. If it is not, then the NumberField() command should complain (which it will not).  After adjoining two roots, create the extension producing a third root, and do the division. You should now have a quadratic factor. Assuming the quadratic is irreducible (it is) argue that you have enough evidence to establish the order of the Galois group, and hence can determine exactly which group it is.  You can try to use this quadratic factor to create one more step in the extensions, and you will arrive at the splitting field, as can be seen with logic or division. However, this could take a long time to complete (save your work beforehand!). You can try passing the check=False argument to the NumberField() command this will bypass checking irreducibility.    Create the finite field of order , letting Sage supply the default polynomial for its construction. The polynomial is irreducible over this finite field. Check that this polynomial splits in the finite field, and then use the .roots() method to collect the roots of the polynomial. Get the group of automorphisms of the field with the End() command.  You now have all of the pieces to associate each field automorphism with a permutation of the roots. From this, identify the Galois group and all of its subgroups. For each subgroup, determine the fixed field. You might find the roots easier to work with if you use the .log() method to identify them as powers of the field's multiplicative generator.  Your Galois group in this example will be abelian. So every subgroup is normal, and hence any extension is also normal. Can you extend this example by choosing a nontrivial intermediate field with a nontrivial irreducible polynomial that has all of its roots in the intermediate field and a nontrivial irreducible polynomial with none of its roots in the intermediate field?  Your results here are typical in the sense that the particular field or irreducible polynomial makes little difference in the qualitative nature of the results.    The splitting field for the irreducible polynomial has degree 168 (hence this is the order of the Galois group). This polynomial is derived from an Elkies trinomial curve, a hyperelliptic curve (below) that produces polynomials with interesting Galois groups:   For the resulting Galois group is , a simple group. If is all matrices over with determinant 1, then is the quotient by the subgroup . It is the second-smallest non-abelian simple group (after ).  See how far you can get in using Sage to build this splitting field. A degree extension will yield one linear factor, and a subsequent degree extension will yield two linear factors, leaving a quartic factor. Here is where the computations begin to slow down. If we believe that the splitting field has degree , then we know that adding a root from this degree 4 factor will get us to the splitting field. Creating this extension may be possible computationally, but verifying that the quartic splits into linear factors here seems to be infeasible.    Return to , and the complete list of subfields obtainable from the .subfields() method applied to the flattened tower. As mentioned, these are technically not subfields, but do have embeddings into the tower. Given two subfields, their respective primitive elements are embedded into the tower, with an image that is a linear combination of powers of the primitive element for the tower.  If one subfield is contained in the other, then the image of the primitive element for the smaller field should be a linear combination of the (appropriate) powers of the image of the primitive element for the larger field. This is a linear algebra computation that should be possible in the tower, relative to the power basis for the whole tower.  Write a procedure to determine if two subfields are related by one being a subset of the other. Then use this procedure to create the lattice of subfields. The eventual goal would be a graphical display of the lattice, using the existing plotting facilities available for lattices, similar to the top half of . This is a challenging exercise, which is code for it is speculative and has not been tested.    "

A Modified Version of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.  A Secondary Section is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.  The Invariant Sections are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.  The Cover Texts are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.  A Transparent copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not Transparent is called Opaque .  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.  The Title Page means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.

VERBATIM COPYING  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.    4. MODIFICATIONS  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:   Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.    Include an unaltered copy of this License.    Preserve the section Entitled History , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled History in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the History section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.    For any section Entitled Acknowledgements or Dedications , Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.    Delete any section Entitled Endorsements . Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled Endorsements or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.  You may add a section Entitled Endorsements , provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled History in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled History ; likewise combine any sections Entitled Acknowledgements , and any sections Entitled Dedications . You must delete all sections Entitled Endorsements .    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an aggregate if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.    8. TRANSLATION  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.  If a section in the Document is Entitled Acknowledgements , Dedications , or History , the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.    9. TERMINATION  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See .  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License or any later version applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.    11. RELICENSING   Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site (or MMC Site ) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A Massive Multiauthor Collaboration (or MMC ) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.   CC-BY-SA means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.   Incorporate means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.  An MMC is eligible for relicensing if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.  The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:  Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the with Texts. line with this:  with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
